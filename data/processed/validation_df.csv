"“She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.” “Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded.",1
"We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.",1
"Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it.",1
He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.,1
"He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.” Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.",1
Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to  cross.,1
"In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them.",1
Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?,1
"Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep.",1
"“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.",1
"In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place.",1
"“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low.",1
"What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.",1
"Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.",1
"I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?” Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt.",1
"And look after Ron.” “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” “Shut up,” said Ron again.",1
Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him.,1
"I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose.",1
"It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.",1
"“Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?",1
"When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.",1
"Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron.",1
I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for.,1
"Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of speed — WHAM!",1
"“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly.",1
Now he came to think about it .,1
"When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.",1
On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat.,1
Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.,1
"“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.” “I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” “But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” “It — well — it shows me my family — ” “And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” “How did you know — ?” “I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently.",1
"And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!” Hermione’s eyes were wide.",1
"“Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.",1
"The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.",1
"Follow me?” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited.",1
“Three up ... two across ...” he muttered.,1
No one could wait for the holidays to start.,1
Then she turned to the twins.,1
Was this normal cat behavior?,1
How nice to see you again.,1
Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual.,1
Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.,1
"Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.",1
"That’ll take a lot of explaining.” Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.",1
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.,1
The dishes in front of him were now piled with food.,1
“What really happened?” It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors.,1
"He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.",1
"The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to drink its blood.",1
Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch.,1
"The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still.",1
“I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog.,1
"Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.” The giant chuckled darkly.",1
"“Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?” “One speed only,” said Griphook.",1
“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating — ” “Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.,1
"Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around.",1
"Just take it and give it a wave.” Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.",1
"Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd.",1
"Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him.",1
"“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in.",1
It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever.,1
There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister.,1
“Quick!” Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door.,1
"“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.",1
He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness.,1
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance.,1
And here they are: Nitwit!,1
"“Having a last meal, Potter?",1
"“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth.",1
"He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears.",1
He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.,1
Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice.,1
“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.,1
"“Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.”  “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.",1
"“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.",1
"He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long  enough to tuck into his belt.",1
"“Yes ...” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got to be taken.” “NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.",1
"“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re done for!",1
"“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron.",1
"One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch  One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set glass or crystal phials 1 telescope 1 set brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS “Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.",1
"Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.",1
"I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.",1
The other two followed him.,1
Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up.,1
“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly.,1
"She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one.",1
"They’ll think I’ve told yeh — ” “See you later, then,” said Harry.",1
"Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground.",1
“Harry Potter ...” it whispered.,1
"Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot.",1
Snape was holding his robes above his knees.,1
"They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.",1
"“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.",1
"Make way, first years coming through!",1
"“An’ don’ say the name!” “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying.",1
"He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.",1
"“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two.",1
"Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” “Wizards have banks?” “Just the one.",1
"“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly.",1
But he had finally gone too far.,1
Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes.,1
Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker.,1
He was pale green by now.,1
"“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said.",1
Wands only — no contact.,1
"But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused.",1
"Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile.",1
"When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased.",1
One of his legs was bloody and mangled.,1
"“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train.",1
"“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently.",1
"Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.",1
"It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.",1
"“Yer not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?” “Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively.",1
"He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.",1
“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face.,1
"“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face.",1
"“Think my name’s funny, do you?",1
"“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.",1
"“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.",1
He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.,1
"I don’t think I can be a wizard.” To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.",1
"Harry, are you all right?” Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.",1
"Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref!",1
"“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure.",1
It was Hermione who spoke first.,1
"Great man, Dumbledore.” “Why were you expelled?” “It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly.",1
"Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.” “They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.",1
"“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.",1
How could he possibly be?,1
“That’s exactly the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match!,1
"He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!” “Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses.",1
"Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards.",1
The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.,1
"See, there was this wizard who went ... bad.",1
Their very last exam was History of Magic.,1
"I can help you there.”  He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.",1
"“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid.",1
“Don’ make me say it again.,1
A bezoar is a stone taken  from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.,1
"“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.",1
"“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” “Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped.",1
“The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone.” Harry looked at the tiny bottle.,1
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.,1
Neville’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.,1
The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.,1
An’ see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-back.,1
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.,1
"“Can’t you — ?” “I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost.",1
There was no mistaking that silver beard.,1
He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky.,1
"“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle.",1
"It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.” “We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said Hermione.",1
The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.,1
Somehow — incredibly — he’d gotten the Stone.,1
"For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again.",1
"And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers — ” “ — unless they crack my head open.”  “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.” Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.",1
"Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.",1
He paced up and down in front of the fire.,1
The evening air had never smelled so sweet.,1
I don’t think I’ve introduced myself?,1
He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.,1
"“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon.",1
"Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine.",1
"He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.",1
He had been hugged by a complete stranger.,1
"Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.” “Five,” said Ron.",1
“What?” “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper.,1
"“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground?",1
He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.,1
Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.” She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 1 7 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way.,1
"“The unicorn’s dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.” “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn.",1
Had it really once belonged to his father?,1
"Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.",1
That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team.,1
They had tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.,1
"“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.",1
"Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?",1
He pulled the door open.,1
“Everywhere else is full.”  Harry shook his head and the boy sat down.,1
It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row.,1
"“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.",1
"“He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?” The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they had one.",1
I need that room ... make him get out.,1
"They’re the only family he has left now.” “You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her  feet and pointing at number four.",1
“An’ keep ter the path.,1
"It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait.",1
"If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.",1
Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.,1
"“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.",1
By nightfall Dudley was howling.,1
"“But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway “You-Know-Who killed ’em.",1
"He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his eyes.",1
"And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.” There was a tap on the dark window.",1
"“I’m his second, who’s yours?” Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.",1
But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?,1
"Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.” They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.",1
It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.,1
"“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.",1
"Come on, then.” Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock.",1
The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak.,1
"“I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months.",1
"“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione.",1
"“Hell have that scar forever.” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t.",1
"“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid.",1
"The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.",1
It is in your very skin.,1
“Weird).” Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.,1
"For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.",1
In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field.,1
How much had he heard?,1
— knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?” Harry thought this was going a bit far.,1
"Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him.",1
"“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter?",1
"His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.",1
There were no photographs of them in the house.,1
"“Show yerself — I’m armed!” And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse?",1
"They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.",1
All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered.,1
"“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore.",1
I just hope Dumbledore believes us.,1
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.,1
"The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.” “What have you been telling him?” growled Bane.",1
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.,1
"Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.",1
"“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.",1
"It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one.",1
"Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.",1
“I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you.,1
She bent down and gathered up the fallen books.,1
The low buzz of chatter stopped  when they walked in.,1
"He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.",1
"And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important.",1
"“We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” “Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.",1
It was a very odd watch.,1
"While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- breaking will lose House points.",1
"“I know it’s here somewhere.”  They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.",1
"Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air.",1
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.,1
"This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope.",1
Platform nine — platform ten.,1
"“I’d have thought you, of all people — ” “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t.",1
"“But first years never — you must be the youngest House player in about — ” “ — a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.",1
"There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.",1
"“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall explained.",1
"Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.",1
"He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked.",1
"When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today.",1
"Help me, Master!” And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.",1
"“If that’s what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.” “What is it?” Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor.",1
"“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them.",1
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen.,1
"“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making,” he began.",1
"“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.",1
"“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh?",1
"Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew.",1
"“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.",1
"Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.",1
"“He’s a funny man, Dumbledore.",1
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.,1
"“Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that.",1
They snapped me wand in half an’ everything.,1
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.,1
It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off.,1
"I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought.",1
Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder.,1
"“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass.",1
"“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” “This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.",1
"He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.",1
"If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared.",1
"“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said.",1
"“Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he?",1
"Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.",1
Famous before he can walk and talk!,1
"Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty ... thirty ...” “Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.",1
"All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from  what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.",1
"Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink.",1
I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.,1
“After what McGonagall and Snape have said?,1
Harry got slowly to his feet.,1
"“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus.",1
What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?,1
"Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.",1
"He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.",1
The common room was packed and noisy.,1
"“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy.",1
"Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that?",1
"He pulled the handle, but it was locked.",1
"Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news.",1
"Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.",1
"“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said greasily.",1
"“Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.” “What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.",1
"“And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.",1
"Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.",1
It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor.,1
"“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed.",1
"People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.",1
“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl.,1
He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much.,1
"“All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor  Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don’t know anything about magic at all.",1
"“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.",1
"Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty.",1
"Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.",1
"Or were they all invisible, too?",1
Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.,1
"” Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive\ Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face.",1
"As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them.",1
"“Give us a look, Lee, go on.” The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.",1
...” And Harry let go.,1
"“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew.",1
"Don’t go back tonight.” “Why not?” “I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already.",1
Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line.,1
"As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.",1
"“Well, now — Mr. Potter.",1
"They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.",1
"They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.",1
"I shall not, of course, lie.” “Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me.",1
"Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney.",1
The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other.,1
"“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly.",1
Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort.,1
"“I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Potter.” “But I thought — Snape — ” “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.",1
"“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.",1
"After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.",1
He started to walk toward it.,1
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak.,1
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips.,1
“Yes ... look ...” A white pawn had moved forward two squares.,1
Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.,1
"Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?” Harry nodded silently.",1
"“Where is this school, anyway?” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time.",1
we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.” “Why?” said Harry.,1
Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.,1
He suspected me all along.,1
Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.,1
“One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it.,1
All Harry’s — it was incredible.,1
"“Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?” “Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.",1
"They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor.",1
At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.,1
Inside was a roughly cut wooden  flute.,1
Run by goblins.” Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.,1
"Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after her, his mouth open.",1
"He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there.",1
"It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life.",1
"“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.",1
He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley.,1
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.,1
"On Saturday, things began to get out of hand.",1
"Where?” Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.",1
"The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.",1
"“That’s your problem,” said Ron.",1
"Just then, the mail arrived.",1
You know that night you won Norbert?,1
"“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to  bed after a very, very long day.",1
"I’ve written them a letter.” “A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall.",1
"I told her you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s made you a Weasley sweater.” Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.",1
"Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.",1
"He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.",1
He couldn’t remember his parents at all.,1
"After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.",1
How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?,1
"With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.",1
"His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.",1
"Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes.",1
“This is the Potter boy.,1
"“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.",1
She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.,1
Or have the planets not let you in on that secret?,1
Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat.,1
"“I won’t let you in,” he puffed.",1
"thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?",1
Hermione did a sort of jig.,1
"He probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy.",1
Send us an answer back with Hedwig.,1
Harry Potter’s coming — he’s got a dragon!” “What utter rubbish!,1
"Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter!",1
"All this You- Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice.",1
He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.,1
Could Snape possibly know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone?,1
"Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader.",1
...” Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.,1
"“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in disgust.",1
“Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!,1
"“Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.” He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.",1
"Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.",1
He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much.,1
This reminded Harry of something.,1
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin.,1
"Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid.",1
"Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again.",1
Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.,1
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.,1
“It doesn’t take a genius to work it out.,1
"Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first.",1
"“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the village.",1
"He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up.",1
"“Well — in that case ...” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung her head.",1
"Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.",1
"“I knew it,” he murmured.",1
"This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate.",1
"•k k k After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.",1
"Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers.",1
"Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.",1
Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.,1
"“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it.",1
"Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.",1
"At the same  instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward.",1
"“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.",1
I thought I’d be seeing you soon.,1
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts.,1
It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.,1
"“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.",1
The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it.,1
"“So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?” Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer.",1
“Better save your own life and join me ... or you’ll meet the same end as your parents.,1
"When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it.",1
"I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.” “Keep your voice down, Neville.",1
"He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.",1
This was part of his and Wood’s game plan.,1
"“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron.",1
"It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.",1
There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from!,1
"I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” More silence followed this little speech.",1
It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.,1
If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or — ” “Blown up a toilet?,1
He’d never felt anything like that.,1
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.,1
"She had dark red hair and her eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.",1
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.,1
A large black and silver volume caught his eye.,1
"“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested.",1
"He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.",1
“He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.” “He’s gone?” said Harry frantically.,1
"When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.",1
“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.,1
"“I’m not ill,” said Harry.",1
He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.,1
"“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.",1
He could see the High Table properly now.,1
“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.,1
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station.,1
"“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.",1
He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground.,1
"“O’ course I can’t,” he said.",1
So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat.,1
I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?,1
"“I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it.",1
"“Just tell us what to do.” “Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” “What about you?” “I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.",1
"They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering?",1
And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise?,1
The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you.,1
"And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet.",1
"He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn.",1
"Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap.",1
"“You drink that,” said Harry.",1
He had only just realized how hungry he was.,1
"At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up.",1
"“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time.",1
"Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!” Only Ron stood by him.",1
"He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back.",1
He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.,1
"He got to his feet, trembling.",1
"“And sir, there’s one more thing ...”  “Just the one?” “How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?” “Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that.",1
"“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.",1
"And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore.",1
"Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.",1
"I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, really.” “But Harry — what if You-Know- Who’s with him?” “Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar.",1
“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.,1
I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...”,1
After lunch they went to the reptile house.,1
You couldn’t find two people who are less like us.,1
“Thank you!” He sat back down.,1
"Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.",1
“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar.,1
"The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.",1
"“Wingardium Leviosal” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.",1
"I can see “Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.",1
And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.,1
That’s why Seekers get fouled so much.,1
"By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.",1
"“Looks like a harp,” said Ron.",1
"He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue.",1
"He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.",1
“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked.,1
"Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.",1
"...” “You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo.",1
“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly.,1
People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.,1
"Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last.",1
"Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.",1
"“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan.",1
"Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching.",1
"Keep the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe on ’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour.",1
"“I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who — ” “Call him Voldemort, Harry.",1
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.,1
"Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.",1
His aunt rapped on the door again.,1
"Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.",1
"Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.",1
"“Light — speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule.",1
"You there, still got yer toad?” Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.",1
"Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.",1
"Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but — ” “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.",1
"By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong.",1
"Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.",1
“Look at me!” he said.,1
"Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.",1
It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all?,1
Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad.,1
"Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick.",1
"“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant.",1
"Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.",1
"Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.",1
"“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid.",1
"“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” “Right,” mumbled Ron.",1
He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione.,1
"Send him, we can afford to lose him.” On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.",1
"“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.",1
"As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.” “Destroyed?” said Harry blankly.",1
"“There, look.” “Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see his face?” “Did you see his scar?” Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day.",1
"Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break.",1
They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.,1
People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten.,1
“Quirrell does not have the Stone.” “Then who does?,1
"They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.",1
“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.,1
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly.,1
"You can keep your bowlers black,  Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.",1
"She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.",1
"Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.",1
He wished Ron would put his wand down.,1
"They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars.",1
“I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.,1
"...” “Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different.",1
"Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate.",1
"I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?” He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth.",1
Are you a common mule?” “Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze.,1
He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train.,1
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.,1
"’Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em.",1
He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.,1
Go on!”  Malfoy didn’t move.,1
“Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks.,1
I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.,1
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.,1
Is that all right?”  Dudley thought for a moment.,1
“There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.” “A werewolf?” Harry suggested.,1
"“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking.",1
"“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered.",1
His name’s been down ever since he was born.,1
"Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.",1
“But that’s no reason to lose our heads.,1
“WEASLEY!” Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.,1
"“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word — ” “Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” “What?",1
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.,1
"It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.",1
"“And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- handed!",1
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter ...” said Dumbledore.,1
"“You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.",1
"Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks.",1
You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort.,1
"The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.",1
“They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment.,1
"“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.",1
"Anyone would want it.” “And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron.",1
Harry was now trying hard not to panic.,1
"“These birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.",1
He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm.,1
"“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying.",1
"Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised.",1
"“I can, can’t I?”  “Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts could be.",1
"Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.",1
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter.,1
Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore.,1
"“You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you?” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.",1
He couldn’t direct it at all.,1
"It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.",1
He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.,1
"“I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’.",1
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing.,1
"You will know, one day ... put it from your mind for now, Harry.",1
"“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.",1
It’s one o’clock in the morning.,1
"Potatoes, Harry?” Harry’s mouth fell open.",1
"Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom.",1
"Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape ’s leg off properly.",1
"“Well, if you see him ...” He left.",1
"“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”  Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him.",1
"“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” He sat up and Hagrid ’s heavy coat fell off him.",1
One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3.,1
"Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.",1
"Except —  “So — back again, Harry?” Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice.",1
"Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words.",1
"“No, we don’t mind,” he said.",1
"If she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air — she and the others existed only in the mirror.",1
"“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks.",1
"A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.",1
It was the first really fine day they’d had in months.,1
"... Well, they’re not completely stupid.",1
"And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.",1
"Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years!",1
"He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that.",1
“Four students out of bed in one night!,1
I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.,1
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.,1
"Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times.",1
She opened the door and poked her head inside.,1
"Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody.",1
"And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.",1
"Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t  met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.",1
It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.,1
"“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”  He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone.",1
"“I start training next week,” said Harry.",1
"“I know what this is — it’s Devil’s Snare!” “Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.",1
"Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” A magic wand .",1
"The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.",1
“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled.,1
"Firs’ years follow me!” Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.",1
The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.,1
"Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.",1
No doubt they thought it would amuse you.,1
It’s just astounding ... of all the things to stop him .,1
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them.,1
Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant.,1
"...” “That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone.",1
"He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.",1
"Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.",1
"Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go.",1
"Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.",1
Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married.,1
"“If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell — ” “There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.",1
"Still, you weren’t eleven every day.",1
“Just come round my house this summer.,1
Scars can come in handy.,1
Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.,1
Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.,1
"“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh.",1
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.,1
“Where ’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.,1
"Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.” On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”).",1
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide.,1
"If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.",1
"Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.",1
"Harry knew, somehow, what to do.",1
"Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.",1
Does that help?”  Harry thought.,1
"“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid.",1
"“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.",1
"“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.",1
“Found the perfect place!” he said.,1
"Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.",1
"In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.",1
"Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.",1
This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.,1
If they don’t get an answer.,1
It was worth a try.,1
“Thank goodness you found me!,1
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people.,1
"The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.",1
"""... for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.” The din was deafening.",1
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.,1
"Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.",1
"There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.",1
Blood was pounding in his ears.,1
"I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” “A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Harry.",1
A door stood ajar to his left.,1
"Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats?",1
He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much?,1
"“In here.” Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.",1
"Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way.",1
"And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us  these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.",1
"He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver  hair, beard, and mustache.",1
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.,1
"...” He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid.",1
Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.,1
"“There is no platform nine and three-quarters.” “It’s on my ticket.” “Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them.",1
"every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach .",1
"“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed.",1
"They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.",1
He walked quickly down the corridor.,1
"If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough ... “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.",1
"“I-I don’t know what you — ” “You know perfectly well what I mean.” An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree.",1
"“What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.",1
"Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets.",1
“Red card!” said Dean furiously.,1
"It’s really very selfish of you.” “And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry.",1
"“You are the Potter boy,” he said.",1
"Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again.",1
How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?,1
Let me see.”  He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket.,1
"He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.",1
"Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop.",1
"Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall.",1
“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured.,1
"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day.",1
"At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return.",1
"“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron.",1
"... Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test.",1
Every morning the ground was covered in frost.,1
"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book was screaming!",1
"“Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.” She turned to the rest of the class.",1
"They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry.",1
Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.,1
"Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.",1
"“Well just have to — ” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.",1
It’s not been an easy journey.,1
"“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes.",1
"When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool.",1
"“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll.",1
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.,1
Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.,1
"Try — ” Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.",1
"It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.",1
"...” Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.",1
"“I might get lucky again.” Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.",1
"well, there’s no other choice ... I’ll run.” He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room.",1
"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls).",1
"“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.",1
"Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” Harry and Ron went back to the common room.",1
"He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”  Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.",1
There was no sign of the bottom.,1
"Jc Jc Jc Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.",1
Harry noticed  that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.,1
"He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.",1
"“Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn.",1
"Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.",1
"“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said.",1
"But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something ... yes, that would be it.",1
“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.,1
"Right, NOW!” Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand.",1
Wizard indeed!” “You knew?” said Harry.,1
"I know it.” He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” “Right.",1
"“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly.",1
“Is it true?” he said.,1
He’d have to say something to her.,1
At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages.,1
She broke my eye contact with you.,1
"“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot.",1
"“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said.",1
"“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it.",1
The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them.,1
It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.,1
"“Hagrid, can we have a window open?",1
"“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon.",1
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again.,1
"Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food.",1
"“The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms.",1
"“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron.",1
“How touching ...” it hissed.,1
"“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron.",1
Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.,1
"“Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick.",1
“But he seemed to really hate me.” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid.,1
"He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?” “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry.",1
They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore.,1
"Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century.",1
"Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he?",1
“And don’t ask questions.” Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.,1
"“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing.",1
"Then he choked and said, “Alas!",1
“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.,1
"She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.",1
“Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.,1
"The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.",1
"“But I c-c- can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles — ” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door.",1
"Then Hagrid ’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid ’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.",1
"He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.",1
"Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.",1
"“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief.",1
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.,1
Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily.,1
They stopped to buy parchment and quills.,1
"It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly.",1
"“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning.",1
"“Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- of-year feast tomorrow.",1
Neville stared at their guilty faces.,1
"“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.",1
"Poor, blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.",1
“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” Grunt.,1
"My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though.",1
"“No.” “Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?” “No ... you go ...” “I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror.",1
“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.,1
Harry decided on the truth.,1
He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived.,1
"“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself.",1
"“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly.",1
In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.,1
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.,1
"I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley!",1
"The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.",1
"’ ” “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.",1
It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see.,1
“That one!” he called to the others.,1
"Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.” “I — don’t — want — ” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.",1
"“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.",1
"He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash.",1
There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.,1
"Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald- green ink.",1
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.,1
"Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.",1
"A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.",1
"“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead.",1
"“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.",1
"“Potter, this is Oliver Wood.",1
"“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked.",1
"They spent most of their free time in Hagrid ’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.",1
The room gradually fell silent.,1
Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.,1
"“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake.",1
“Why should he?”  Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that.,1
"Use it well, the note had said.",1
"“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.",1
Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question.,1
"“This is boring,” Dudley moaned.",1
Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.,1
"“But your friend — Nicolas Flamel — ” “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.",1
We’ve no business staying here.,1
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.,1
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).,1
"“And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.",1
“Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this .,1
"“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter.",1
Harry looked up at the giant.,1
"“I forbid you to ask him, Fred.",1
Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.,1
The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it.,1
"He was going to be expelled, he just knew it.",1
"Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.",1
"He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.",1
Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.,1
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.,1
He grunted and offered him another rock cake.,1
"The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear.",1
"“Set him free.”  “I can’t,” said Hagrid.",1
"So where shall I put you?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.",1
"Harry couldn’t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever.",1
You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year?,1
"Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.",1
"“What?” Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what.",1
"About what finally stopped him?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now.",1
"When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.",1
"“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.",1
"With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.",1
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.,1
"Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad.",1
"“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished.",1
"Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside.",1
“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out.,1
"It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.",1
"Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away.",1
"“Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?",1
"They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.",1
"“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now.",1
"Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it.",1
"He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way.",1
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.,1
"“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the crowd.",1
“It’s  them as should be sorry!,1
"Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches .",1
"A second, very small parcel contained a note.",1
"“My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” “Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.",1
"It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!” Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.",1
"and what a waste of time, when after all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” Quirrell snapped his fingers.",1
They didn’t tell him much.,1
He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.,1
"By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size.",1
"Malfoy ’s eagle owl was always bringing him  packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.",1
"Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted.",1
"Very strange strangers they were, too.",1
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.,1
"She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora\” The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.",1
"“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves?",1
Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning.,1
"“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them!",1
"Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.”  Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose.",1
What if they walk into you?,1
"“Nothing, nothing ...” Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten?",1
"Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course.",1
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.,1
"“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall.",1
"He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back.",1
Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace.,1
I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked.,1
"“Hagrid, he’d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him.” “Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid.",1
"Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.",1
"He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room.",1
"Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.",1
"“Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.",1
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall.,2
"“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously.",2
"The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers.",2
Her face was covered in black fur.,2
"...” Deaf to Harry’s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase.",2
Then he forced it into an awful smile.,2
"...” Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd.",2
And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives.,2
Malfoy would probably tell us anything.,2
"“What?” “It’s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,” said Ginny.",2
Harry Potter must not put himself in peril.,2
"He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.",2
"Mind you, she’ll go crazy when she finds out we’ve got exams in three days’ time.",2
"“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely.",2
"Well, of course, I knew at once why you’d done it.",2
"Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn’t Petrified.",2
But I wasn’t going to waste those long years I’d spent searching for it.,2
"“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Professor McGonagall heavily.",2
“Bet you five Galleons the next one dies.,2
"“Harry — oh, Harry — I tried to tell you at b- breakfast, but I c -couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it was me, Harry — but I — I s-swear I d-didn’t mean to — R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over — and — how did you kill that — that thing?",2
"“An’ how many did yeh have ter threaten an’ blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?” he roared.",2
"Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time.",2
"“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside — ” “But — ” stuttered Fudge.",2
There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.,2
"“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule.",2
"“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across his face.",2
"“I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,” Harry said.",2
Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work.,2
"“Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the gamekeeper’s cabin came into view.",2
"Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side.",2
"“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you — ” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.",2
"He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes.",2
Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.,2
"As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.",2
The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink.,2
"Christmas morning dawned, cold and white.",2
"A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron’s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.",2
Hermione was dancing on tiptoes.,2
That’s the thing to bear in mind.,2
"His nose was also slowly lengthening — their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.",2
“Gotta bone ter pick with yeh.,2
"Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail- less, and fur-free, at the beginning of February.",2
"Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.",2
"The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of  clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots.",2
"“Harry, Harry, Harry.” Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.",2
"...” He raised the wand — Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry’s lap — the diary.",2
"Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom’s elbow slipped off his desk.",2
"Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.",2
"From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.",2
Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.,2
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal.,2
I forgot He looked into Harry’s face.,2
How — what — where did that bird come from?” Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.,2
"“Or maybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of  armor or something — I’ve read about Chameleon Ghouls — ” “You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches.",2
“How will they get home?”  “They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently.,2
"...” Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything.",2
"Why’s Potter lurking — ” Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault.",2
Wash away the memories of last term!,2
"The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.",2
"This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two.",2
Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch.,2
“I died.” “How?” said Harry.,2
"and if you try and magic yourself out — they 11 expel you!” And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.",2
"But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not — ”  Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering.",2
"You’ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.” Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry.",2
"Madam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl with long, curly hair.",2
"Ginny didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn’t think who.",2
"Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car.",2
"Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more.",2
"Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!” “Well — I must say — when I took the job — ” Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his robes, “nothing in the job description — didn’t expect “You mean you’re running away?",2
"The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck.",2
"Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn’t his idea of being innocent.",2
"There’s a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now.",2
"“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend).” drawled Malfoy.",2
"There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown.",2
It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind!,2
"“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering.",2
"Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably.",2
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.",2
"“Why so modest, Gilderoy?” Harry gave a start.",2
Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room.,2
And I’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he’s always banging on the pipes and groaning.,2
“ Freshly caught Cornish pixies.” Seamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself.,2
"Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors’ noses in the early morning sun.",2
"Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, “There are good things in there, too.",2
"It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he’d put it on.",2
"Harry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin ’s heir was quite ludicrous.",2
"Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek hair was disheveled.",2
...” Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room.,2
"I mean to say, if Potter’s marked him down as his next victim, it’s best if he keeps a low profile for a while.",2
"There was a loud crack, and Harry’s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air.",2
Lockhart beamed down at him.,2
"He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.",2
"And you, Miss Granger — you can partner Miss Bulstrode.” Malfoy strutted over, smirking.",2
What he saw nearly made him pass out again.,2
"Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.”  Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures.",2
"“Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.” “Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny.",2
"After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside.",2
The car gave a nasty wobble.,2
He tried very hard to look as though he couldn’t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb.,2
"She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.",2
"“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,” he went on.",2
A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue  with a thousand more black candles.,2
"Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren’t interested in whether he had his bones back or not.",2
"“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly.",2
"Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.",2
"“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?” Mr. Malfoy’s lip curled.",2
“An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’ he decided ter go.,2
I’m in no hurry.” Harry felt drowsy.,2
"Ron started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.",2
"Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it.",2
“Have you — did you read — ?” he sputtered.,2
"“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead,” said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.",2
“Excellent.” said Fred and George together.,2
“We’ve got to get her out of here.,2
"Now that he was awake, he couldn’t understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making.",2
"He knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn’t have explained.",2
"Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury.",2
...” Harry slumped back onto his pillows.,2
"Harry, however, was completely lost.",2
Head still hanging in there?” He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.,2
"Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits.",2
"” Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, “So — what’s bothering you?",2
"“And speaking of Gryffindor — ” Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: “Professor, when we took the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor shouldn’t really have points taken from it — should it?” he finished, watching her anxiously.",2
"OUT!” And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm.",2
"A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head.",2
"The basilisk’s head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him.",2
"Ill expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.” The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.",2
"With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two.",2
"A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, “Calmly, please, ladies.",2
"I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.",2
"His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence.",2
"“Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.” He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.",2
Ron’s knuckles were white on the steering wheel.,2
"“All I saw,” said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, “was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.” “I didn’t chase it at him!” Harry said, his voice shaking with anger.",2
"“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.",2
"Harry felt it shudder — he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin’s mouth.",2
"Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley.",2
"Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t.",2
"“So you never — never attacked anyone?” “Never,” croaked the old spider.",2
"It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in.",2
"Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, “It can’t be Harry Potter?” The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry’s arm, and pulled him to the front.",2
“No one knows how he survived that attack by You- Know-Who.,2
“D’you know what?” said Ron.,2
"When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, “Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don’t they?” She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench.",2
"This didn’t help, as Harry had never heard of such a place.",2
"“Loads more than I do,” said Ron, shaking his head.",2
“What’s a boy in his class saying about you?” Hermione wondered.,2
"If this is dying, thought Harry, it’s not so bad.",2
"“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view.",2
“Is there anything missing?” Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk.,2
"Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap.",2
"Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.",2
"As eleven o’clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium.",2
"But I mean to say — look at the fellow — ” “I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, “Nick’s very — frightening and — er — ” “Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head.",2
THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU!,2
Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones.,2
A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.,2
"A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.",2
"I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.” She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.",2
“I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might’ve been Bill.,2
"Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.” “Don’t be thick,” said Fred.",2
"“Somewhere over there,” said Ron, pointing along the shelves.",2
... Harry knew there was only one thing to do.,2
I wouldn’t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days.,2
"“No one’s died this time, not even the cat.",2
"“Minerva found him on the stairs.” “There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” said Professor McGonagall.",2
"There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.",2
"Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture.",2
"Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen.",2
"He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile.",2
“Why haven’t you been answering my letters?,2
"Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance — Gringotts Bank.",2
There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn’t pink and fluffy.,2
"A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.",2
"His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all.” “Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” George explained, seeing Harry’s puzzled look.",2
“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?” Ron asked Hermione.,2
"“Stupid — useless — thing — ” “Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.",2
“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink.,2
"Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?” “No, sir, it was the barrier at King’s Cross, it — ” “Silence!” said Snape coldly.",2
He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he’d been in here.,2
“Did you see — ?” He looked up.,2
"“Why aren’t yeh in class?” “Canceled,” said Harry, getting up.",2
"Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.",2
"“They’re not girls.” “No,” Hermione agreed.",2
"He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead.",2
"Goyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class.",2
"Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes.",2
Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course?,2
His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin’s.,2
"Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, “Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?” “Scared?” muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn’t hear him.",2
"“The soot — “Don’t fidget,” said Ron.",2
"If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you.",2
He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache.,2
From any witch or wizard?,2
And on the bed next to her was —  “HermioneY’ Ron groaned.,2
The leaves were growing right out of his head.,2
"“If yeh ask me, she wouldn’ say no ter a signed — ” “Oh, shut up,” said Harry.",2
He saw Ron — and then he saw Harry.,2
"A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.",2
"Hasn’t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are.",2
"“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms.",2
"“Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.” Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow.",2
“Then we’ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.” The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays.,2
"Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop.",2
“The moment they know the de-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look.,2
"“Pass the frying pan.” “You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry irritably.",2
"They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.",2
"“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron — ” Ron woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.",2
"I’ll have to report this, you know!” But Harry didn’t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day.",2
"“Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,” growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his  scrubbed table and setting down the teapot.",2
Cursed — Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.,2
Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint.,2
"Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.",2
Then one of us can sneak into Snape’s office and take what we need.” Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.,2
There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard!,2
"“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said Harry, trying to cheer him up.",2
“Here — and here — ” “Come and look at this!” said Hermione.,2
Each was the size of a large boulder.,2
Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return.,2
"“You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.",2
"“My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends.",2
I don’t like the sound of that school food.,2
But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.,2
"“You’ve been told to get all Lockhart’s books, too!” he said.",2
"“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor.",2
...” “But why don’t you leave?,2
"“Thank you, Harry,” said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass.",2
"“Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts.",2
"“What ’re you two doin’ here?”  “What’s that for?” said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside.",2
"Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger.",2
"So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing — ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him?",2
"“Almost,” said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.",2
"“Well, gotta be off,” said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley!",2
Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed — but Harry understood what he was saying.,2
"Harry jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron’s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.",2
"“Well all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny.",2
"“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he said to Harry.",2
"“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.",2
“What’re you doing here?” he said.,2
“I could help them.” Ron’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual.,2
"“You’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,” he said softly.",2
"“Oh, come on,” said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince.",2
"Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.",2
"But that’s what the Seeker’s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught.",2
"It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry’s side.",2
"“Ron, how did you — What the — ?” Harry’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him.",2
...” “But how do we prove it?” said Harry darkly.,2
"“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic outside school,” said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes.",2
"Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she had almost smiled.",2
"You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog.” He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.",2
Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket — “STOP!,2
"There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around.",2
Music was coming from somewhere.,2
"There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn’t look worried and tense, and any laughter that  rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.",2
I’ve never watched a Quidditch game before!” Colin scrambled through the hole after him.,2
"“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin.",2
"Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.",2
"Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.",2
"What are you doing?” It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines.",2
"To speak to you.” “Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you get it.",2
“I — I don’t think I’m going to come after all.,2
"“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice.",2
Who can tell me why?” Hermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as it shot up again.,2
Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.,2
"One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion.",2
Harry had no time to reply.,2
"He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him.",2
Hit him instead of us.,2
"“Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling.",2
You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head- Juggling and Head Polo.,2
"Now that the Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon.",2
“And — did you say it’s been opened before ?,2
"“All right, I’m cornin’,” said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat.",2
"Otherwise, Riddle wouldn’t have got his award.” Ron tried a different tack.",2
"It’s ready.” Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.",2
"But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice.",2
Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet.,2
"Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity.",2
"He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why — any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed.",2
"Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up.",2
"“Ooooooh, wait till you see,” she said.",2
"... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know where we’re going to get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — thatll be tricky, too — and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.” “Excuse me?” said Ron sharply.",2
"Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.” Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they’d avoided detention.",2
That’s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.”  Harry’s mouth fell open.,2
"...” “The right what?” said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too.",2
"What a lovely game, I don’t think!” “Who threw it at you, anyway?” asked Harry.",2
"He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands.",2
"When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded.",2
"How exactly — ”  “Not now, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley.",2
"He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel.",2
"“Let’s go and see,” said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.",2
“Do use your common sense.,2
"“Ask him\” shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry.",2
"“What’s that?” asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione’s pillow.",2
"“I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed their bags by now,” Malfoy went on.",2
"“I,” said Percy, drawing himself up, “am a prefect.",2
"He didn’t seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone.",2
"Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.",2
“Your Quidditch team?” said Harry.,2
"And I’ve seen the real you, I saw you last year.",2
"Surely you want to go home for the holidays?” “No,” said Riddle at once.",2
"Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk.",2
"“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich.",2
“Why couldn’t we get through the barrier?” Harry shrugged.,2
"“Dear me, what’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you well for it?” Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.",2
"I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me.",2
"Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.",2
"“What are you talking about, Harry?",2
Someone’s idea of a joke.,2
"“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing.",2
"He’s not even that good, it’s just because he’s famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead.",2
“Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by then.” “What’ve you been feeding them?” said Harry.,2
"Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, “Er — I’ll just go, shall I?” Still the wizard ignored him.",2
"He wanted to ask, “What are you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, “Who are you?” “Dobby, sir.",2
"He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy.",2
"“You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named, remember?",2
Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal — if it hadn’t been for the owl.,2
He opened the back of the camera.,2
"“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said desperately.",2
"“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably.",2
"“We’ll have to watch our step from now on, though,” he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice.",2
"“Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley.",2
“Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before he was satisfied.,2
"“Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth.",2
"At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry’s room to the open window.",2
"“Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.",2
"“Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace — ” “But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.” Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire.",2
"“Get up,” said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.",2
"Oliver Wood’s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.",2
... I’m locking you up.,2
"“Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — dodgy place, Harry — don’ want no one ter see yeh down there — ” “I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again.",2
"Then it came to him — “Professor Dumbledore,” he said hurriedly.",2
"“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively.",2
"“Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,” said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag.",2
the death of that poor little girl.,2
"There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly.",2
"Harry wasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.",2
"“That voice!” “Sorry?” said Lockhart, looking puzzled.",2
"Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn’t seem keen to make his views heard.",2
"“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for quiet.",2
"Just for background reading.” She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly.",2
"“Said she was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin’ she might run inter someone else at my house.” He winked at Harry.",2
"“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered.",2
"We even look something alike ... but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me.",2
"Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack.",2
You’ll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself.,2
"“Hiya, Harry!” “Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically.",2
"They stood still, their heads inclined toward Filch’s voice, which sounded quite hysterical.",2
We’re in the Chamber of Secrets.,2
"And — ” “All right, I’ve got the point,” said Harry.",2
“It’ll hear you.” “Hear me?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice.,2
YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM!,2
Ron looked as though he’d just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.,2
"“And, Dudley, you 11 say — ” “May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.",2
"“All we’ve got to worry about now are airplanes,” said Ron.",2
"He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn’t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor.",2
"It looked bad, all right .",2
"“Harry, it’s our car!” “What?” “Come on!” Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.",2
"“Look at his family,” said Harry, closing his books, too.",2
"“Honestly, we’re much better off without her.” Ginny ’s lip trembled.",2
"Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, “ Expelliarmus\ ” Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.",2
Do you know what did kill that girl?” said Harry.,2
“Please ... they’ll kill me.,2
"He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea.",2
Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered.,2
"With  difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up.",2
"But I don’t get it — even someone invisible would’ve had to open the door.” “I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him.",2
"“IVoooooo!” Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.",2
"“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,” said George.",2
"Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.",2
They might as well close the school tonight.,2
What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s secret ambition?,2
"The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window.",2
"As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry’s growing list.",2
"“Well have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Harry told Ron.",2
"Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir!",2
“A student has been taken by the monster.,2
"“Well, as to that — most unfortunate — ” said Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a  drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag.",2
"You’ll be back with  your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry.",2
"Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew.",2
His face was suddenly masklike.,2
"Malfoy,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got something for you — ” And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy’s hand.",2
"Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.” “But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley.",2
"I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.” Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides.",2
“I don’t understand why the gateway’s sealed itself — ” Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach.,2
"Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death.",2
“And we’re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger!,2
He had never been this deep into the forest before.,2
"Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.",2
"What if, even worse, I told you who’d been strangling roosters?",2
"Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall’s voice, magically magnified.",2
"“Wood’s been teaching us new moves.” He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air.",2
"“Stand back,” said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves.",2
"Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy- learn course.",2
"As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.",2
"Why didn’t you show the diary to me, or your mother?",2
In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys’ hedge.,2
Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it’s bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.” There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.,2
"There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked.",2
"Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.",2
"“It could be dangerous.” “ Dangerous ?” said Harry, laughing.",2
They could easily be Slytherin’s descendants.,2
"Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron’s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think you’re doing?” “Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up.",2
Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber.,2
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night.",2
"She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.",2
"I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but ...” His voice trailed away hopefully.",2
"What if she’s still there?” Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight.",2
"“Shut up, Malfoy.” “You’re just jealous,” piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe ’s neck.",2
"“ ‘Get the Snitch or die trying,’ what a stupid thing to tell him—” Madam Hooch had joined them.",2
And then Harry heard it.,2
My friend Ron — ” He stopped again.,2
"When dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I’ll bring the subject around to drills.",2
"It didn’t carry details of why it had been given to him (“Good thing, too, or it’d be even bigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said Ron).",2
The man who followed could only be Draco’s father.,2
"The sooner he got out of here, the better.",2
Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.,2
Ron got the point at once.,2
"“My cat has been Petrified!” he shrieked, his eyes popping.",2
"“What now?” Ron’s voice said, sounding desperate.",2
"“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.",2
It was a nightmare — Dad was working overtime for weeks.” “What happened?” “The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose.,2
And something was stirring inside the statue’s mouth.,2
"“Dumbledore couldn’t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be — well — human.” As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened.",2
"Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on Harry’s head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan.",2
“I wanted to — to get this book out of the library.,2
"“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked Malfoy.",2
"“Not a bad turnout,” said Nearly Headless Nick proudly.",2
Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them.,2
Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror.,2
Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.,2
“Are you cra2y?” said Ron.,2
"“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,” she said promptly.",2
"“Go back to the dormitory?” “No,” said Harry, glancing around.",2
"“I bet there aren’t many living people who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll be fascinating!” “Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?” said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy.",2
I wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me.,2
Even his hair was turning red.,2
There was a knock on the office door.,2
"Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle’s wails echoing off the bathroom walls.",2
"Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.",2
I’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.,2
"“We’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.” Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.",2
They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays.,2
"“The Chudley Cannons,” said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C’s and a speeding cannonball.",2
"Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor.",2
“The basilisk kills people by looking at them.,2
"“Weasley, you can partner Finnigan.",2
...  Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end.,2
"Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here, sir!",2
"Harry, Fred, and George followed.",2
"“I must also return to the feast.” When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.",2
This is an Order of Suspension — you’ll find all twelve signatures on it.,2
"“Wait here,” said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire.",2
"I won’t say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing.",2
"Broke all records!” “No,” said Harry frantically.",2
“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.,2
"“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!” But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!” There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward.",2
"“No idea,” said Myrtle in hushed tones.",2
"“I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night.",2
Let’s hear what it’s all about.,2
"Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound.",2
"Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.",2
"It was a clear, starry night.",2
"“Oooh, it might have hidden powers,” said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely.",2
"You found it, and I couldn’t have been more delighted.",2
"Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling.",2
...” Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.,2
"I thought he was a bit of an idiot,” said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible.",2
“I knew yeh hadn’t really.,2
"“Snape can’t prove it was you,” said Ron reassuringly to Harry.",2
Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.,2
"“I know we still haven’t found out who’s doing the attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys’ drawing room.” Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror.",2
They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.,2
"With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, “Diagon Alley!” and vanished.",2
“That’s who he was writing to all last summer.,2
"Not now?”  “What’ll we do?” said Ron, aghast.",2
"...” Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart’s office.",2
“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic — he said hell chuck you out of the house — and you haven’t got anywhere else to go — you haven’t got any friends to take you — ” “ Jiggery pokeryV ’ said Harry in a fierce voice.,2
"An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails.",2
...”  Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling.,2
“Lumosl” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again.,2
"Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.",2
"By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.",2
"They went, as quickly as they could without actually running.",2
Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him.,2
"She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked.",2
"After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.",2
He knew now where he was being taken.,2
"If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy — however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see ...” Snape was looking murderous.",2
"All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home.",2
"“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy.",2
... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time .,2
"“I mean, everyone hates him — ” “Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he’s waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the school train.” Harry spun around.",2
"... As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past.",2
"Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",2
THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU!,2
"“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tensely.",2
Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper.,2
"Hopefully we’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.” “What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?” “He works in the most boring department,” said Ron.",2
“There has been another attack ... another double attack.” Harry’s insides did a horrible somersault.,2
"“Riddle’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to Ron.",2
"“You’re just worried I’m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy — ” “Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge.",2
“But all we’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden.,2
"“ Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, “but the governors feel it’s time for you to step aside.",2
"...” “But — but — ” “My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.",2
"Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years.",2
“To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road.,2
"For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees.",2
“I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage.,2
"Pretending he hadn’t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.",2
"Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face.",2
"Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible.",2
"But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today’s issue of the Evening Prophet “You were seen,” he hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES.",2
"Harry Potter, at my deathday party!",2
"Hermione had overridden Ron’s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.",2
Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him.,2
The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families.,2
... Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn’t take this cheerful view.,2
"She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her.",2
You can clear off now!” Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood.,2
"But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst.",2
"Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir.",2
"“Ah, Riddle,” said the headmaster.",2
"Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch.",2
"He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.",2
"...” Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, “Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load  of rubbish.",2
"“When Draco points his wand at you, you do this.” He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it.",2
"Together, they heaved it onto a bed.",2
...” “Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?” said George.,2
"Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry’s knees, choked, “Tarantallegral” and the next second Harry’s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep.",2
"There’s nothing I can do.” “You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint.",2
He was still holding Ginny’s old  Transfiguration book.,2
"“I haven’t been properly dry since August”) “ — and we’re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.” Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.",2
"“Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days ... I’d say it’d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.” “A month?” said Ron.",2
They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don’t stop.” “What d’yeh — ” “I don’t think you meant to kill anyone.,2
Took ages to get the slime off.,2
"“Dumbledore already knows you’re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a trick, that man.",2
"Riddle’s reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.",2
"“You must speak clearly, dear,” Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot.",2
"“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.” He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before.",2
"“Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school.",2
"“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry’s and Ron’s stupefied faces.",2
"She leered at him, showing mossy teeth.",2
"It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard.",2
This was the worst he had ever felt.,2
A songbird and an old hat!,2
"They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.",2
“I just — ” “I WARNED YOU!,2
“All that junk about Lockhart being so great — ” Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves.,2
“We’ve been here nearly four hours!,2
"“We’re attracting too much atten — ” “Harry!” said Ron, his eyes gleaming.",2
Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like.,2
He gazed miserably into the hedge.,2
... Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner.,2
Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber.,2
"Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, “ Serpensortial” The end of his wand exploded.",2
"“But there is something you could do for me,” said Nick excitedly.",2
"“Ginny,” said Ron in an undertone to Harry.",2
Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place.,2
What have I always told you?,2
It took a long while to get started next morning.,2
"And what’s he doing here?” He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.",2
"Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.” He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, “ That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place.",2
"I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban — we need our gamekeeper back.",2
"Not just any dwarfs, however.",2
"And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!” “Uh-oh,” said Ron.",2
"“Why all these long faces?” People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.",2
Enough to let me leave its pages at last.,2
"She tapped the diary three times and said, “Aparecium\” Nothing happened.",2
"“Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards.",2
“How thick can you get?” Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them.,2
"At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.",2
"“Your bird — I couldn’t do anything — he just caught fire — ” To Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.",2
Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills).,2
"He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: “Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me ...” No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist.",2
"STOP!” he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them — “WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!” Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late — CRUNCH.",2
"There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.",2
"You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?” Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed around the courtyard.",2
"“Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!” “Sword?” said Lockhart dimly.",2
“How come you haven’t got any cards?,2
“But — you must admit it’s weird.,2
“We think it’ll help you.” “Er — well — it’s not terribly — ” The side of Lockhart’s face that they could see looked very uncomfortable.,2
"“All right,” said Hermione coldly.",2
Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.,2
"Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.",2
... Would anyone believe he hadn’t had anything to do with this?,2
“I found it inside one of the books Mum got me.,2
"Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest.",2
"“Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.",2
"“He must’ve been Muggle-born,” said Harry thoughtfully.",2
"Harry, however, didn’t feel very sleepy.",2
"Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then,  moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.",2
"And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.",2
"Pinch it hard, it’ll stop bleeding in a second, Boot — “I think I’d better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,” said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall.",2
"“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, too?” said Harry desperately.",2
"He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again.",2
He looked at Lucius Malfoy.,2
There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I don’t know how they got there.,2
"Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next.",2
There will be no more evening activities.” The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence.,2
It was a different world.,2
"On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things.",2
"I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?” he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily.",2
...” “Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.,2
"But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming.",2
"...”) He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop.",2
"“Come on,” Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, “nearly there, come on — ” The engine groaned.",2
"“There!” Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump.",2
His head was spinning as though he’d just traveled miles by Floo powder.,2
"“This is for the Daily Prophet “Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it.",2
"Prod of Didsbury says: “My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak!",2
Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.,2
"“So — what’s the story, Harry?” said Ron impatiently.",2
"Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful.",2
"“The first words out of those poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘It was Hagrid.’ Frankly, I’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.” “I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.",2
Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber.,2
"Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.",2
5 The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry’s liking.,2
"He was waiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion.",2
"...” “Mum fancies him,” said Fred, in a very audible whisper.",2
"Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.",2
All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed.,2
"“To business, Harry,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly.",2
If only there was something they could do.,2
"“When you’ve finished eating, you may leave.” Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t there.",2
"“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy.",2
"“The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,” he said.",2
"D’you think — would it be all right if — can I have a picture?” he said, raising the camera hopefully.",2
"They couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch.",2
"I’ve never seen a de-gnoming — ” “That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,” said Mrs. Weasley.",2
"Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard’s bank, Gringotts.",2
History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule.,2
"“Together, you and I are worth the front page.” When he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers.",2
"Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart’s books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing.",2
Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off.,2
"“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?” piped up Professor Flitwick.",2
A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face.,2
I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin.,2
Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did.,2
"Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open.",2
"The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other monsters didn’t want to name it.",2
In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid ’s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen.,2
"Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick.",2
"“You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry.",2
"Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.",2
No student is to leave the dormitories after that time.,2
"He’d have to tell a teacher all about the  diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago?",2
"Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was.",2
"I hope they’re paying you overtime?” He reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration.",2
"Tom, what am I going to do?",2
"A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound — except that there was no wound — “Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly.",2
Ron was clenching Crabbe ’s gigantic fists.,2
He felt a bit awkward.,2
"Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he’d just swallowed live snakes — doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick — then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes — next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax — and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small — As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped.",2
"Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.",2
"He is too important, sir!” “What terrible things?” said Harry at once.",2
I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power.,2
"Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror.",2
"“And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver,” said George.",2
"“Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasley — ” he said, opening the door a bit wider.",2
"“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent.",2
"SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE: The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart  Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry’s.",2
“Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle.,2
“Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed!,2
The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn’t enjoyable.,2
"Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark.",2
"As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar.",2
All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them.,2
“Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself.,2
"He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.",2
"“My dear boy,” said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry.",2
"“Oh, no — ” Ron gasped.",2
"The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders.",2
"“What a night,” he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him.",2
"“It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced — ” “He did it, he did it!” Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling.",2
"After a few minutes’ progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry’s ears.",2
"“Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not that — however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to write up Peeves’ report — go — ” Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs.",2
"From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room.",2
"It drives Mum mad.” “That’s the main road,” said George, peering down through the windshield.",2
“It was a c-cat hair!” she howled.,2
“All students to return to their House dormitories at once.,2
Something was slithering up from its depths.,2
"And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we?",2
Have you read his books?,2
I think Myrtle’s grown fond of you!,2
They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all.,2
So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back.,2
"“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, “I’m ready.",2
"“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously.",2
"The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one.",2
"“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,” said Fred, “but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.” There was a small click and the door swung open.",2
"“ ’Course,” said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, “we might get to the forest and find there’s nothing to follow.",2
"“Well — it’s not funny really — but as it’s Filch,” he said.",2
"Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, “Let’s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can’t feel it!",2
Everyone knows that’s the mark of a Dark wizard.,2
Ron opened his mouth in horror.,2
"“Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.” Mr. Weasley blinked.",2
"Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual.",2
“W-what am I supposed to do?” he stammered.,2
"This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it.",2
They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.,2
If we hadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out.” He retched and ducked out of sight again.,2
"Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after- dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason’s head, and swooped out again.",2
...” Ron suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm.,2
"“Me,” he said, pointing at it and winking as well.",2
"Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron.",2
Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.,2
"We’ve trained harder than they have, we’ve been flying in all weathers — ” (“Too true,” muttered George Weasley.",2
"Meanwhile,  Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.",2
"He cleared his throat and said, “Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of this nature — ” “It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys’ punishments, Severus,” said Dumbledore calmly.",2
"""... but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions — good girl!",2
"Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water.",2
"“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.",2
"Help me — help me — Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat.",2
"Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely ... At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.” Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.",2
"“You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.” Lockhart stepped forward eagerly.",2
"“We’re taking no more chances,” Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door.",2
“We do not name it!,2
"They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS.",2
"He didn’t know anything about his father’s family, after all.",2
"“Crime ... befouling the castle ... suggested sentence ...” Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry, who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.",2
"As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something.",2
...”  Harry said nothing.,2
"I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces.",2
"“So?” “Oh, Ron, wake up,” snapped Hermione.",2
"...” “Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter.",2
The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time!,2
"“I know I shouldn’t ’ve enjoyed that or anything, but — The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.",2
"“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily changing the subject.",2
"“What’s going on?” Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.",2
"“I covered up for you back there with young Creevey — if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won’t think you’re setting yourself up so much.",2
“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry.,2
"“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow ...” But nobody heard much more.",2
The contents of Harry’s trunk had been thrown everywhere.,2
She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question.,2
Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.,2
I think he suspects me.,2
"Percy said, “As a school prefect — ” but Harry had lost his temper.",2
"Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes.",2
"“Harry Potter set Dobby free!” “Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning.",2
"“Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,” said Peeves, his eyes dancing.",2
"How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort’s powers were destroyed?” There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.",2
"Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people’ll be talking about that one for years — “Good for you,” said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he’d just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?” Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn’t look happy at all.",2
"“Your whole fascinating history.” His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier.",2
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn’t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn’t joined in.,2
Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.,2
"A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and — CRASH.",2
I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here.,2
"I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.” He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on the draining board instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he ripped open Hermione’s letter and read it out loud: “ ‘Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there, “ ‘I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn’t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too.",2
"As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.",2
Harry almost said something apologetic to  Percy but caught himself just in time.,2
“If you’re talking about Malfoy — ” “Of course I am!” said Ron.,2
"“But this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else.",2
"With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.",2
“Right.” “I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons.,2
The rest of Harry’s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory.,2
Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed.,2
"""... rip ... tear ... kill ...” It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart’s office.",2
Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape’s desk.,2
"“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said.",2
“Third time this week!” he roared across the table.,2
"“But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else knows our password — ” “Exactly,” said Harry.",2
"“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Riddle.",2
“I don’t blame him for wanting to stay here.,2
"“Hannah,” said the stout boy solemnly, “he’s a Parselmouth.",2
"He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby.",2
"When Filch wasn’t guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like “breathing loudly” and “looking happy.” Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris’s fate.",2
“You sleep with this under your pillow?” But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine.,2
"“It’s never too early to think about the future, so I’d recommend Divination.",2
"“Explain,” she said, her glasses glinting ominously.",2
...” He scanned the page in his hand eagerly.,2
I hear you’re a useful player.,2
Ron didn’t need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.,2
"Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.",2
Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw.,2
"“But — ” “Later,” Harry said shortly.",2
...” Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.,2
"“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow.",2
"At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.",2
"He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.",2
He thrust it under Ron’s nose.,2
"We can talk later — ” “We’re going to talk now,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry’s wand.",2
"Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed.",2
"“I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ” “Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” barked Snape over the class’s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose.",2
"“It’s awful — ” They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head.",2
"“Can you hold him still, Harry?” “Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily.",2
"He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.",2
"“I’ve just got one question, Dobby,” said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry’s sock with shaking hands.",2
More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic?,2
Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.,2
"“Oh, I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something.",2
"What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart’s greatest achievement to date?",2
Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.,2
There was a sudden movement behind them.,2
"“What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?” Harry gaped at the wizard.",2
"Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys’ bedroom.",2
“We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning.,2
"“Where?” And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face.",2
"Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing Muggle-borns.",2
"A decent headmaster would never ’ve let slime like that Creevey in.” Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: “ ‘Potter, can I have your picture, Potter?",2
"“What’s that thing — hanging underneath?” said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.",2
I think she’s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.” Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.,2
"“Why,” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have you outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?”  Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.",2
They stared at each other.,2
"I’ve been wanting a word — you don’t mind if he’s a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?”  Judging by Professor Sprout’s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, “That’s the ticket,” and closed the greenhouse door in her face.",2
It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream.,2
"It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.",2
Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes.,2
"“So I can prove I’ve met you,” said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward.",2
"He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.",2
“NO!” Harry heard Riddle screaming.,2
"He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet- black hair.",2
"“It’s not much,” said Ron.",2
"The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.”  “Well, you see, Lucius,” said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, “the other eleven governors contacted me today.",2
...” Dobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and hugged him.,2
"“Come, Draco Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.",2
The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset.,2
"“You don’t want to start any trouble or your mommy’ll have to come and take you away from school.” He put on a shrill, piercing voice.",2
"“All right, Harry?” asked George.",2
"Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin?",2
"Harry and Ron exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner.",2
Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all?,2
"“It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickly.",2
"Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth.",2
"Her Pepperup Potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward.",2
"Dobby did it for the best — ” “Have you been stopping my letters?” “Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf.",2
"“I’m rather busy at the moment — if you would be quick — ” “Professor, we’ve got some information for you,” said Harry.",2
"“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.",2
"Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it.",2
“But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done.,2
I come from a distant land.,2
"He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom’s copy of Travels with  Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front.",2
"“Hocus pocus — squiggly wiggly — ” “MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house.",2
"“That’s how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.” “Hermione, are you okay?” said Harry through the door.",2
"And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.",2
"Harry went over to the  Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.",2
"“It means,” said Dumbledore, “that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.” Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth.",2
"I said, come.” But Dobby didn’t move.",2
"And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone —  A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late.",2
"“Come on,” said Harry wearily, “we’d better get up to the school.",2
"Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.",2
“We’ve forgotten the way to our common room.” “I beg your pardon?” said the girl stiffly.,2
"“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.",2
...” It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom.,2
"Tell me, Dobby!” He seized the elf’s bony wrist as Dobby’s hand inched toward the water jug.",2
"All those times I could’ve died, and I didn’t manage it?",2
I will be writing to both your families tonight.,2
"... Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.” Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury.",2
“You’ve used spiders in Potions loads of times.,2
He had never been in a wizard house before.,2
"“My office is nearest, Headmaster — just upstairs — please feel free — ” “Thank you, Gilderoy,” said Dumbledore.",2
"“What’s the matter with you two?”  Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.",2
"N G HARRY POTTER / Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive.",2
"There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front.",2
"“Yeah, Dad’s crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff.",2
"’ But when I  was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now.",2
"Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!”  “This is all your fault,” George said angrily to Wood.",2
"“Moste Potente Potions?” she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn’t let go.",2
"“It’d be worth more than his family’s whole house — ” Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, “Look out!” “What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him.",2
"“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak.",2
"“I mean, she was a pureblood.",2
"“Most unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me.",2
He couldn’t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.,2
"Come on, let’s have a look.” And ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she opened the door.",2
Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.,2
"“I just asked her if she’d seen anything odd, and she started to say — ” “Oh — that — that’s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,” said Percy at once.",2
“Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it.,2
"Can’t I?” Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken.",2
"After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.",2
"He’d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it.",2
"Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent.",2
"“Straight ahead!”  Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.",2
"“It’s the crack of dawn.” “Exactly,” said Wood.",2
"Haven’t you even got friends at that freak place?” “Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” said Harry coolly.",2
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.,2
Flying a car to Hogwarts!,2
"Harry didn’t know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming “You solved it!",2
"Mopping all night, like I haven’t got enough to do!",2
But Harry was glad that most people were leaving.,2
"And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,” he added thoughtfully.",2
He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls.,2
"“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly.",2
“Lucius Malfoy must’ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he’s told dear old Draco how to do it.,2
"They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley’s face.",2
"“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above him.",2
"Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully.",2
"He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he’d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.",2
"“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him.",2
"“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to — ” All three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.",2
"“Listen,” said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, “with you two flying around me all the time the only way I’m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve.",2
"“It’s because he’s bursting to say it’s really him,” said Ron knowingly.",2
"“When in doubt, go to the library.” Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great  Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.",2
"“Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!” The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing.",2
... You will be safer by far at your orphanage.,2
"They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves.",2
"“It’s not funny,” said Ron, fiercely.",2
Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they’d accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room.,2
"People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.",2
"The Heir of Slytherin’s one, too.",2
"Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see  that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation.",2
"“You hold Ginny’s other hand — ” Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry’s robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes’s strangely hot tail feathers.",2
The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all.,2
"“It’s me,” he said, closing the door behind him.",2
“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?” he said.,2
"He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.",2
"“That,” said Ron fervently, “was the best story you’ve ever come up with.” They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall’s permission to visit Hermione.",2
"They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase.",2
"“You could havedied, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job  It seemed to go on for hours.",2
"A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands.",2
"“What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?” Harry asked, scratching Fang’s ears.",2
"“Didn’t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?”  Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.",2
"I’m — I’m Colin Creevey,” he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward.",2
"Yes, yes, I know what you’re thinking!",2
They sent Lockhart in first.,2
"White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.",2
"And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them.",2
... You’re never going back to that school .,2
Harry knew perfectly well they’d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn’t squashed him flat.,2
"A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose.",2
It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry.,2
A hush fell over the onlookers.,2
"“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!” said Hagrid urgently.",2
Myrtle’s whole aspect changed at once.,2
I caught the person who’d opened the Chamber and he was expelled.,2
"Near sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.",2
“Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?” He looked at Hermione.,2
“It’ll take your head off.” Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.,2
He couldn’t see how Ginny could still be alive.,2
He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby.,2
“Well?” said Mr. Malfoy sharply.,2
"“ ’Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply.",2
"No one’s ever understood me like you, Tom.",2
“Three — two — one — go!” he shouted.,2
"Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course — but I daresay you’d rather go to the school feast?” He watched Harry on tenterhooks.",2
"Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule- breaker.",2
Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley.,2
He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn’t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold.,2
"They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, “Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through.",2
“Haven’t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe?,2
"Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out.",2
Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible.,2
At last Dumbledore straightened up.,2
"By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party.",2
“This makes the Dursleys sound almost human.,2
He tried to move his fingers.,2
“And the attacks must’ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out.,2
"...” “She didn’t want us showing off,” said Ron sagely.",2
"Someone would’ve seen ...” Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page.",2
"“If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.” “Anyone can make a mistake,” said Hermione.",2
“Fine — I’m fine — go on — ” Harry looked at his watch.,2
"“Muggle father, witch mother.” “And are both your parents — ?” “My mother died just after I was born, sir.",2
"Dobby the house-elf,” said the creature.",2
"“Bet he asked you to say that!” “If I could have everyone’s attention, it’s time for my speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding  toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.",2
"Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.",2
He wants to be Minister of Magic ...” Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.,2
"Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle.",2
“That tree did more damage to us than we — ” Ron blurted out.,2
"I was a Seeker, too.",2
"“Shame,” said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut.",2
"Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid’s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds.",2
Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him.,2
“That Ravenclaw girl — Penelope Clearwater — she’s a prefect.,2
"Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore.",2
"Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk.",2
"We’d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser — ” “I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight — ” They reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven.",2
"I’ll go now,” he half-shouted.",2
"“I expect you’d have Father’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job — I’ll tell Father you’re the best teacher here, sir Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron.",2
"He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.",2
"“No — don’t — ” said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry’s arm.",2
"Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley’s address.",2
"In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs.",2
"It must be nearly time to leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time.",2
"“And this diary is fifty years old,” said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.",2
...” He mopped his glistening bald patch.,2
"“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,” said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a  clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.",2
My books wouldn’t have sold half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things.,2
"“She’s — she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly.",2
"“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes.",2
Harry didn’t even have time to turn around.,2
"“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or what?” Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower.",2
"...”  Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass.",2
"...” “I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,” said Hermione darkly.",2
“Dumbledore was just passing it on to me.,3
"After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblinlike creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost.",3
"It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on?",3
"“It’s all right, Crookshanks,” Hermione cooed through the wickerwork.",3
"When he’d finished, Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth.",3
"He lowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight.",3
"...” “Well, thank you very much, Minister.” Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again.",3
"On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished.",3
Ron was furious with Hermione too.,3
"Not only was this the last answer he’d expected, but Lupin had said Voldemort ’s name.",3
"“Where’s Buckbeak, Hagrid?” said Hermione hesitantly.",3
"Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following him.",3
"“Blimey, my ’eart’s goin’ that fast...” “So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?” Harry prompted apologetically.",3
"He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it.",3
"A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry.",3
"Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.",3
“And walked up to school with you floating on it.,3
"Surely Black, as Voldemort’s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?",3
"Fact was, it was too easy ter trace.",3
Lupin moved closer to Ron.,3
"Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigrew’s reach.",3
"Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the password, then pretending he’d left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back.",3
"So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it.” Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his Seeker, Wood said, “But Black couldn’t have bought a Firebolt!",3
"“Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the knight, and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.",3
"“I’ve been alone with him loads of times, having defense lessons against the dementors.",3
"His eyes had fallen on another book, which was among a display on a small table: Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming.",3
"“The falcon ... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.”  “But everyone knows that,” said Hermione in a loud whisper.",3
But Snape was beside himself.,3
"“Now, really!” said Professor Trelawney as everyone’s heads turned in their direction.",3
"“What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves’s grin faded a little.",3
"Ron and Hermione watched Harry nervously all through dinner, not daring to talk about what they’d overheard, because Percy was sitting close by them.",3
"“Fine,” said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.",3
"For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she didn’t say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat.",3
"Dementors can’t see, you know.",3
"On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them.",3
I hope it’s not too long — it’s two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for.,3
“We’ve got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the  hospital wing.,3
Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry.,3
He didn’t know what he wanted to do.,3
Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked twice at Harry.,3
"“I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess.",3
"The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it had been torn away completely.",3
"I did express my concerns when you appointed — ” “I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,” said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn’t reply.",3
"“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight face.",3
His teeth were gritted with pain.,3
"But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you.",3
"I tell you, he was here!” They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first, and they sprinted back down the staircase.",3
"“Come on, last time we went you didn’t see anything.",3
"“As you’re all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween.",3
YOU WERE HIS SPY!” “He — he was taking over everywhere!” gasped Pettigrew.,3
He trickled a few drops down Trevor’s throat.,3
"Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction.",3
"Harry’s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the tree, looking around.",3
Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file.,3
"“ What did you say to me, Potter?” “I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled.",3
"“Yeah,” said Harry, looking quickly toward the door.",3
Hagrid was looking downcast and Harry wanted Hagrid ’s first lesson to be a success.,3
"Indeed, I don’t remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.” There was a moment’s silence.",3
“Do you realize how much luggage you’ve all got between you?,3
“What — what happened?” he groaned.,3
"“Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly.",3
The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.,3
This directed Aunt Marge’s attention to Harry for the first time.,3
"He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward.",3
Did they think he couldn’t look after himself?,3
"Now, please stop badgering me.” To make matters even worse, Harry’s anti-dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped.",3
“I’d blow meself up before I set foot in that place.,3
"“Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late; Crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket, stretched, yawned, and sprang onto Ron’s knees; the lump in Ron’s pocket trembled and he shoved Crookshanks angrily away.",3
"Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised — He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch.",3
"big, blurred shapes were moving around him ... then came a new voice, a man’s voice, shouting, panicking — “Lily, take Harry and go\ It’s him\ Go!",3
His heart plummeted — had she told Professor McGonagall?,3
"He hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.",3
"The grindylow’s empty tank stood  next to his battered old suitcase, which was open and nearly full.",3
"“It’s okay ...” He turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.",3
"“My friends ... my old friends ...” Black’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a warning look, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and casual.",3
Harry moved his head over on the pillow.,3
Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart.,3
"And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it .",3
"“Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?” said Fudge.",3
"Harry stood staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands.",3
"And the worst that happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.",3
They didn’t need telling twice.,3
"It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn’t have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.",3
"Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout “Severus, you’re making a mistake,” said Lupin urgently.",3
"“I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast.",3
And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.” He glanced around again.,3
... She was only trying to help.,3
"Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire.",3
"“How’re we getting to King’s Cross tomorrow, Dad?” asked Fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.",3
"“Shh!” Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.",3
"“Unemployed.” “As I expected!” said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve.",3
"What with that, and the whispering that still filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind.",3
"At long last, the train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville’s pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat.",3
“Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said.,3
The stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard’s robes that had been darned in several places.,3
"“Yeah ...” Face dry, Harry looked up.",3
"“I’m going to see if he’s okay!” said Pansy, and they all watched her run up the marble staircase.",3
"Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.",3
"And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a hurry.",3
"“Maybe a vampire,” suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.",3
Bin up since five gettin’ everythin’ ready.,3
Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.,3
"“Harry, you’d better beat him in the Quidditch final!” Hermione said shrilly.",3
"...” Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew’s clutching hands and backed away against the wall, looking horrified.",3
"Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him.",3
This map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been warning against.,3
"“Nox,” they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands went out.",3
"Barely alive, Voldemort had fled.",3
A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top.,3
"Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason  the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it.",3
"No, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero.",3
“ ’Ear about that ’Arry Potter?,3
"Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him.",3
“Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour’s quiet crystal gazing.,3
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying.,3
"He had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a nasty-smelling liquid into the other player’s face when they lose a point).",3
"“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she said, checking her purse.",3
It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts.,3
"Go on,” he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot.",3
"Close-up, Harry saw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.",3
"“Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned.",3
"“Fine!” she repeated, swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair.",3
"Had their joke succeeded, he would have been expelled from Hogwarts.” Snape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.",3
"“But the match,” said Harry.",3
"And as you might’ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone’s hump.” “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,” sighed George, patting the heading of the map.",3
"“I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,” said Professor Trelawney in her mistiest, most faraway voice, “and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you.",3
"“Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before.” “You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione.",3
"A large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them, “Password?” “Coming through, coming through!” Percy called from behind the crowd.",3
"The Minister of Magic.” Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but as he had been wearing his father’s Invisibility Cloak at the time, Fudge wasn’t to know that.",3
"“Right, Neville,” said Professor Lupin.",3
... Why didn’t the dementors get Sirius?,3
Hermione ’s white face was sticking out from behind a tree.,3
"So he  finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom.",3
"“There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the gap.",3
“I’ve had enough of this.,3
"They heard footsteps, the soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once more.",3
“How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.,3
I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus.,3
I wouldn’t have believed it possible.,3
"Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he’d done?",3
"“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them.",3
"“I didn’t mean to,” said Harry while Ron roared with laughter.",3
The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him.” Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth.,3
“Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black.,3
"...” Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking.",3
...” “What do you mean?” breathed Hermione.,3
"Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it was dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll — Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again.",3
Fog was clouding his eyes.,3
“I haven’t got ten Galleons.,3
"“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before.” “There had to be one time you didn’t get it,” said George.",3
“He dresses like our old house-elf.” But no one else cared that Professor Lupin’s robes were patched and frayed.,3
"... You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.” “But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !” “Pettigrew owes his life to you.",3
“You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s escaped from!,3
"This is brilliant!” Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.",3
"“Hagrid, are you in there?” There was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open.",3
... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon?,3
Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.,3
“There’s nothing we can do!,3
"“You don’t believe this — this madness, Remus — ” “I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,” said Lupin evenly.",3
"“What’s the score?” “We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get the Snitch soon, we’ll be playing into the night.” “I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses.",3
"“Why?” “Leavin’, isn’ he?” said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to ask.",3
"Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near.",3
"“OY!” Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously.",3
“And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled Snape.,3
Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to sign.,3
"...” Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his front feet.",3
"His thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand pointing straight at Black’s heart.",3
"“Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hindquarters.",3
"“And?”  “And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow.” Harry’s insides lurched.",3
"Td rather not witness this.” He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing behind him.",3
We were walking down to Hagrid’s three hours ago.,3
"However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of paddock.",3
Harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep.,3
Snape’s behavior toward Harry over the past week had been quite alarming.,3
"As Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great Hall opened again.",3
"“We lost by a hundred points, right?",3
Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities.,3
"“How old is this rat?” “Dunno,” said Ron.",3
"“Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry.",3
“Why are you carrying all these around with you?” Ron asked her.,3
"Harry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and he broke off.",3
They had reached the trees.,3
"It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky.",3
“She seemed to think it was safer.,3
"“Straight into the forest, all right?",3
The hall was starting to empty as people headed off toward their first lesson.,3
I was a good pet.,3
We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again!,3
“How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together.,3
We’ve got to keep out of sight!,3
It was skirting the edge of the forest now.,3
"“This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he said.",3
"You’d have thought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword.",3
"Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope.",3
"“I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,” he said gently.",3
"Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself.",3
The class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath.,3
"But that was the easy part, I’m afraid.",3
"“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d never be able to get it and — ” “Harry, we mustn’t be seen!” “How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione fiercely.",3
"People were striding past him in the opposite direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted.",3
You notice the abnormally long fingers?,3
"That’s all I need to know.” “You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now.",3
"...” “It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than usual.",3
"“If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves, I’m not sure I’ll be studying it much longer!",3
"Good luck.” Dumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his wand to magically lock it.",3
The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier.,3
"Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder.",3
"“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office,” she told them.",3
“Just trying to imagine what he’s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.,3
“What?” There was a loud whistle.,3
"Gryffindor common room, now!” “Right,” said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the rest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the stadium and back up to the castle.",3
"Any second now, he might hear his mother again .",3
She lowered her huge eyes to Harry’s cup again and continued to turn it.,3
I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I’ve found out.,3
"I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people.",3
"“We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,” Malfoy said to Ron.",3
"“D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?” Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive.",3
"“I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?” Harry frowned at Ron.",3
“But ... from what I could see ... it looked like him.,3
"“Oh, that’s nice,” said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.",3
"And Ernie McMillan told me she’s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the same time as Divination, and she’s never missed one of them either!” Harry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione’s impossible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape’s essay.",3
"Severus, you’ve made the potion for him again?” “Yes, Headmaster,” said Snape.",3
“Well — there might have been!” said Hermione.,3
"Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair.",3
"Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd.",3
...” “Up to the castle?” said Snape silkily.,3
You will need only your wands.” A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books.,3
"“Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling them further.” Snape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior, to  Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses.",3
I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true?”  Harry seized the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.,3
"It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he, Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and three-quarters.",3
Harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive.,3
"You haven’t forgotten that he once tried to kill me?” “My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly.",3
He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor.,3
Nobody was very happy about this.,3
"Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in.",3
They’ve even got the axe ready!,3
Something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass.,3
"“Harry doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?” Again, Harry didn’t answer.",3
"As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited muttering.",3
"“In you get, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded street.",3
"She settled herself  behind her desk and said abruptly, “Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.” Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.",3
"All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon’s car pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path.",3
"“I’m their brother!” “But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as though the idea were ludicrous.",3
How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew?,3
Have you got a house?,3
"“That’s all, I swear.” Harry stepped out of the way.",3
"Enjoy your stay, Harry.” And with a last smile and shake of Harry’s hand, Fudge left the room.",3
"Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life.",3
"Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks had landed on Ron’s head in the Magical Menagerie.",3
"I’ll write him a note, explaining.",3
"“Where is he, Sirius?” Harry looked quickly at Lupin.",3
"“What’s going on?” said Ginny, who had just arrived.",3
"And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn’t usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?",3
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle’s house.,3
“They see the Grim and die of fright.,3
"They reached King’s Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights.",3
"“Take ’er away, Ern,” said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to Ernie’s.",3
"Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.",3
"I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.” “That explains a great deal,” said Professor McGonagall tartly.",3
"I’ll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I’ll call you.",3
Had he been seeing things across the lake?,3
"Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down.",3
“I am going to lock you in.,3
“We got as much as we could carry.”  A shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry’s lap.,3
"The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around his bed.",3
"“Full marks.” Flushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione.",3
"They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling  Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she’d made as a young girl.",3
"Malfoy was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling.",3
All five of them stared at it.,3
"“Er — because there are so many of us, it won’t know what shape it should be?” “Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed.",3
"They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window.",3
A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry like poison.,3
Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams.,3
"“It was just an idea, I just thought But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle.",3
You keep away from me.”  He fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.,3
His mother was screaming in his ears.,3
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around the same round table.",3
Why are we in here?,3
He was drowning in cold.,3
"“Any sign of him, Professor?” asked Percy in a whisper.",3
"He watched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces.",3
"He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him — “Imagine that,” said Professor McGonagall dryly.",3
Then he turned a corner into a clearing and — “AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH !,3
"If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.” There was a great shout of laughter.",3
Dumbledore wouldn’t laugh — he could tell Dumbledore .,3
"Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to read.",3
"“That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in Harry’s ear.",3
This time Neville charged forward looking determined.,3
"“If we hurried, we could go down and see him.",3
I think — I think it might be us!” Hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door.,3
The Snitch had vanished again.,3
...” The taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as though Black had bellowed it.,3
"... You’ve got to help me, Remus.",3
"“Well, they do,” said Hermione.",3
Harry tried to pull himself together.,3
"Your mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt, would they?",3
"“If you’ll give me a chance, I’ll explain.",3
“It’s what dementors do to  those they wish to destroy utterly.,3
"All right, then ... if she wanted to tail him, she’d have to take the consequences.",3
There was a rushing in his ears as though of water.,3
...”  His eyes filled with tears.,3
"She looked around at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain.",3
"Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head.",3
"Anyway, when little ’Arry Potter got the better of You- Know-’Oo — ” Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again.",3
The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened.,3
He pushed up his visor and toasted them with a flagon of mead.,3
"... Rise again, indeed — ” “But you just said it!",3
Your owl will find me.,3
He was furious they’d come onto the grounds.,3
"However, Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin’s words, except to blow a loud wet raspberry.",3
Ron and Hermione left Harry’s bedside only at night.,3
"“Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I’ve just remembered!",3
"AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?” “N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice.",3
"She stared at Harry for a moment or two, then said, “I see!",3
"“Stay where you are!” Harry shouted, running forward.",3
"Though quite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.",3
I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape; there aren’t many wizards who are up to making it.” Professor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands.,3
"Crabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie.",3
"“I’ve waited twelve years, I’m not going to wait much longer.” “All right ... but you’ll need to help me, Sirius,” said Lupin, “I only know how it began ...” Lupin broke off.",3
Only one door was open.,3
"When Harry relieved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched its wings, and took off through the window into the night.",3
"He paused as he entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile, “I haven’t poisoned that chocolate, you know.",3
"“After you,” said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.",3
You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt.,3
"Black’s a madman, Harry, and he’s dangerous — ” “Malfoy’s dad must have told him,” said Harry, ignoring Ron.",3
"And he said it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking.",3
"“It’d be good to get some more money — ” “Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained.",3
I feel sure we’ll meet again sometime.,3
"“One moment, please!” she called as the class made to leave.",3
“Irish International Side’s just put in an order for seven of these beauties!” the proprietor of the shop told the crowd.,3
"...  “Get out of it, Potter!” Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him.",3
"“Did you feel how cold it got when it came in?” “I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably.",3
"I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!” Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the whole room.",3
Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes.,3
The sun was setting now.,3
"“Hagrid would like that,” said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and Hermione.",3
"A fat, dapple-gray pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly.",3
Where’s that — that thing?,3
Harry broke away from the table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to her.,3
— told me Peter had left blood on the sheets.,3
"“You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to Snape.",3
“Er — shall I make a cup of tea?” said Ron.,3
"Just then, there was a rustle at the window and Hedwig fluttered through it, a note clutched tight in her beak.",3
"“Only if we’re more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup.",3
"“And he’s supposed to be our teacher!” Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK!",3
"Petunia, I’d write if I were you.",3
"“Just ignore him, it’s not worth it.",3
"“This door’s been locked, we just saw — ” “THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape howled, pointing at Harry and Hermione.",3
She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion.,3
"His eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor Lupin’s name, and he was bullying Neville worse than ever.",3
"“The point is, even if you’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder’s Map.",3
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.,3
"“That’s the first time I’ve ever heard him — he tried to take on  Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run for it.",3
Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later ... done flobberworms or summat.,3
"“I wasn’t too happy myself,” said George.",3
"“This cat — Crookshanks, did you call him?",3
... What would happen when he told the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they’d seen on television... !,3
"His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a traitor.",3
"“I’ve been covering up for you — ” “Hermione, listen to me, please!” Lupin shouted.",3
Harry felt a bit better.,3
He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time.,3
Read ’em off a little piece of paper!” Professor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd.,3
"“I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on,” came Hermione’s voice.",3
"“ ’Choo say ’is name for?” “Sorry,” said Harry hastily.",3
His nerve had failed him.,3
Its handle glittered as he picked it up.,3
The fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.,3
"“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he said.",3
“Everyone gather ’round the fence here!” he called.,3
Then they named him godfather to Harry.,3
"“A no- account, good-for-nothing, lazy scrounger who — ” “He was not,” said Harry suddenly.",3
"“Is that a Sneakoscope?” said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a better look.",3
"“I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly.",3
Hermione and Harry leaned forward.,3
...” They set off up the High Street.,3
"“I heard about the match,” said Lupin, turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase, “and I’m sorry about your broomstick.",3
“My transformations in those days were — were terrible.,3
"Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively.",3
"“Someone’s spilled their candle.” “This is such a waste of time,” Hermione hissed.",3
She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one.,3
"Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden idea.",3
His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort.,3
“Fasteri” But something odd was happening.,3
Dumbledore looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking.,3
“Sh — she said I’d failed everything!” It took a little while to calm Hermione down.,3
"“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, who knew Diagon Alley very well by now.",3
"It was Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord.",3
Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.,3
"In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground.",3
“Just standing here and watching it happen?” He hesitated.,3
Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking.,3
"“Er — are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?” “What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it.",3
"... “Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder.",3
"“What’s this, Hagrid?” Hagrid’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who picked it up and read aloud: Dear Mr. Hagrid, Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.",3
"they had no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.",3
"Professor Trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, “So you have chosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts.",3
Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other’s hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other’s fingers.,3
"“Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas.",3
"They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading.",3
"Powers gone, horribly weakened, he fled.",3
All three of them were rather giggly.,3
The sky was getting a little lighter.,3
"He’s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says shell be able to make him better.",3
“Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!,3
“He’s trying to make you do something stupid.,3
Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night.,3
Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn’t feel more scared.,3
He jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement.,3
"“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m packed,” Harry said to Ron, and he went downstairs.",3
It was time for the rescuer to appear — but no one was coming to help this time — And then it hit him — he understood.,3
They sneaked out of the castle every month under James’s Invisibility Cloak.,3
...” Harry looked desperately around.,3
"He’s been sighted once already” “Black’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,” said Ron.",3
"They’ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve stopped making them.",3
"“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up.",3
"“Er — ” “What?” said Harry, looking from one to the other.",3
"Crookshanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like entrants in a six-legged race.",3
“I DONT KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT!,3
"I need to speak to the driver, excuse me ...” He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.",3
“But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon.,3
Is Longbottom telling the truth?,3
"Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he’d done any such thing, was taken aback.",3
"I didn’t really expect Black to linger.”  “Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?” asked Snape.",3
You wouldn’t even be here if it wasn’t for my dad!”  Snape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.,3
"He had never wanted anything as much in his whole life — but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nimbus Two Thousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom already?",3
"He forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant: “Expecto patronum).",3
... That must never happen again.” “You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever had!” said Harry.,3
"Would he be arrested, or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world?",3
...” Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak.,3
“You need to sign too.” The footsteps stopped.,3
"At last, exhausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a ray of  moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleep.",3
"Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street.",3
Nothing changed when they left school.,3
"All it did was hover, like a semi-transparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it there.",3
...” He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.,3
"Blimey, who’d spend that much on you?” “Well,” said Harry, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it wasn’t the Dursleys.”  “I bet it was Dumbledore,” said Ron, now walking around and around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch.",3
"Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies.",3
"“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering out of control, “and all the time you’ve been his friend!”  “You’re wrong,” said Lupin.",3
"They were both wide and musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish arms.",3
"Remember the form, he told himself.",3
"“No,” said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave.",3
"HE’S SAVED IT!” Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee’s commentary.",3
Scabbers was huddled in Ron’s hands.,3
“Here — ” She had thrown the chain around his neck too.,3
"three — two — one — ” Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which was being provided by the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan.",3
He could hear yelping in the distance.,3
"It’s only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.”  “Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same.",3
"You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.” “What’s that?” “They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a slightly twisted smile.",3
He considered Harry for a moment.,3
"“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly.",3
They reached the dark landing.,3
"“And last,” Fred muttered under his breath.",3
But Harry could hardly swallow.,3
"He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding.",3
"“How come you’re not going to Hogsmeade?” “We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,” said Fred, with a mysterious wink.",3
I could be catching up on Cheering Charms — ” Professor Trelawney rustled past.,3
The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits.,3
"Personally, I try and treat him like any other student.",3
“I’d better put it upstairs — ” “I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly.,3
"If I’m proud of anything I’ve done this year, it’s how much you’ve learned.",3
"“Come on, Alicia!” yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd.",3
“I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said Wood.,3
I still want to see him.,3
"It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up — “Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession — no!",3
"“But if we’re with him,” said Ron spiritedly to Hermione, “Black wouldn’t dare — ” “Oh, Ron, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped Hermione.",3
"“What’s happened?” he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for Astronomy.",3
“Got a real treat for yeh today!,3
"...” “ Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead — ” Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s brain.",3
"“Vernon Dursley speaking.” Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard Ron’s voice answer.",3
"It’s — ” But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out.",3
"Eyewitnesses — Muggles, of course, we wiped their memories later — told us how Pettigrew cornered Black.",3
"He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it.",3
She placed the chocolate on Harry’s bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.,3
"Could you leave it here on the desk for me?” Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and Lupin.",3
“Perhaps you’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year.,3
"And it’s Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in the eye, Angelina!",3
"And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him, just as he became aware of something moving on the field below.",3
Let’s — let’s go down and see Hagrid.,3
... “And they didn’t desert me at all.,3
"The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know.",3
"“If he’s seeing things like — ” “What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?” said Snape softly.",3
“Get behind here — behind this bush — I’ll explain.” Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet again.,3
"“What about poor Scabbers, eh?” He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was curled up in his pocket.",3
"“I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning.",3
"Dumbledore’d go ballistic,” said Fred confidently.",3
"“He been a bit off-color ever since I brought him back from Egypt.” “Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocket.",3
"Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed Uncle Vernon to the front door.",3
"“Look at the state of his robes,” Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as Professor Lupin passed.",3
I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN’ TRAITOR!” Hagrid roared.,3
"And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!” Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room.",3
... Hermione’s leg gave a nervous twitch next to him.,3
"“See?” Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again.",3
"“I hope you’re well?” said Percy pompously, shaking hands.",3
"“You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his wand hand quite steady.",3
"He hung a few inches above the ground, his limp feet dangling.",3
There’s nothing we can do.,3
"Hermione irritated the rest by fussing about how her tortoise had looked more like a turtle, which was the least of everyone else’s worries.",3
She looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure.,3
"He sat down on his bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages, searching, until ...",3
"Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as “this is stupid” kept drifting across it.",3
"Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor.",3
"Harry scanned the map carefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled Severus Snape was now back in its office.",3
“Professor Lupin gave me some.,3
"I bet he’ll get off — ” “Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures!” choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.",3
It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight.,3
"“That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment.",3
"“You made that dementor on the train back off,” said Harry suddenly.",3
I’d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry.,3
"“He betrayed my parents!” “This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry.",3
"Just here!” “How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore.",3
"“All right, Hagrid!” said Ron.",3
"She had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed.",3
"“We think you’re very good too, Oliver,” said George.",3
"You’ll be able to move them back in tomorrow.” “And the Fat Lady, sir?” “Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor.",3
"3 Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk.",3
“What are you doing?” Filch snarled suspiciously.,3
"Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron had to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered with his wand.",3
"“In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on, “we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with fire omens, that is.",3
“Yes ... please pack away your things.,3
"“How about these?” said Ron, shoving ajar of Cockroach Clusters under Hermione ’s nose.",3
"“What’s that?” said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand.",3
"“Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked.",3
"Though Harry had by no means forgotten about Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.",3
"“What the — ?” Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing so hard.",3
"They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin.",3
Any chance of meeting you there?,3
"The moment when he’d first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts!",3
"He used to belong to my brother.” “What powers does he have?” said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.",3
“How did you do that?” squealed Angelina Johnson as George started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.,3
"“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said.",3
"one that he could turn into a good, strong Patronus ...",3
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain weekends.,3
"Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly.",3
"Still standing in the doorway to the bus, he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.",3
"Then, without warning, he pounced.",3
“But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.,3
“What’s that thing outside your window?” Harry turned to look outside.,3
"He didn’t have a clue where he was, or how he’d got there, or what he’d been doing before he got there.",3
You can’t just Apparate in here.,3
There wasn’t much room inside.,3
"“I see ... ,” said Professor McGonagall.",3
"“Beau’iful, aren’ they?” Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant.",3
“You’re talking nonsense!” “YOU DONT KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape.,3
"“So simple ... so brilliant ... he cut it off himself?”  “Just before he transformed,” said Black.",3
“He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle!,3
"This way, you haven’t broken your word to Fudge and I know what’s going on.” “Harry, you must be very scared — ” “I’m not,” said Harry sincerely.",3
"... Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow — an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog.",3
“I can’t believe I missed Cheering Charms!,3
"Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.",3
"“Sorry, didn’t see her!” A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s club at the back of Flint’s head.",3
"The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone who’d listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub.",3
Something flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes.,3
Where are we going to go?,3
"In a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.",3
"He clicked his fingers, and the ends of the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands.",3
He gave the rope another wrench.,3
"“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here — ” There was a loud thud.",3
"Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the wand.",3
"Sirius Black ... Peter Pettigrew ... and, of course, your father, Harry — James Potter.",3
It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again.,3
"He said he’d have time after Christmas.” “Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing.",3
They watched Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle.,3
He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside.,3
"Whether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers’s squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell.",3
"“I’ll do it.” As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.",3
Mum wouldn’t let Ginny come in the last one.,3
Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night.,3
"“Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge thickly.",3
Now will you listen?” Harry didn’t know what to think.,3
The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw.,3
"Buckbeak isn’t dangerous.”  “Malfoy’s dad’s frightened the Committee into it,” said Hermione, wiping her eyes.",3
"“Okay, team, let’s go for it!” Hermione ’s spell had done the trick.",3
the Potters have made me their Secret- Keeper.,3
“I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets.,3
Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term.,3
Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time.,3
their last hope was gone.,3
” They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina’s way was clear.,3
"Harry, however, wasn’t feeling cheerful.",3
"“So ...” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that Harry should do the same.",3
How’s that going to help Sirius?” Harry stared at her shadowy face.,3
"“When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I’d betrayed Lily and James.",3
"But make it quick, Remus.",3
"“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything — ” “Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him.",3
"“Harry isn’t supposed to leave the castle, Ron — ” “Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry, sitting up, “and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!” Further discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn’t what Ron had had in mind.",3
Floating in midair.” There was a long silence.,3
"Can you imagine what it might have been, Potter?” “No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.",3
...” These words jolted Harry to his senses.,3
I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid’s hut.,3
“But ... maybe I imagined it.,3
"They could each turn into a different animal at will.” “But how did that help you?” said Hermione, sounding puzzled.",3
"They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed all around the school, Black’s chances of getting inside seemed very remote.",3
"Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle.",3
"“You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf.",3
“We’re all down there ... and now we’ve just got to wait until we come back up again.,3
"Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.",3
"Professor Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.",3
"I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was in my dream, you know?",3
That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!” She snatched up her bag and stalked away.,3
"Why had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?",3
"“If he really is a rat, it won’t hurt him.” Ron hesitated.",3
The book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room.,3
"He had to wait only a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by Professor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the Great Hall.",3
"“He’ll live,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly.",3
"“I don’t need help,” Ron whispered.",3
"After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise.",3
"Careful not to make any noise, Harry began to climb.",3
"“Do they use the cane at St. Brutus’s, boy?” she barked across the table.",3
"He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the staffroom door.",3
They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in Azkaban before.,3
"“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,” Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall.",3
"They reached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.",3
"At least twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs.",3
The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing.,3
"Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.",3
"Professor Lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher.",3
He lost track of time.,3
“Do you think Black’s still in the castle?” Hermione whispered anxiously.,3
"Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it.",3
"“Thanks,” Harry said to Ern.",3
"Ron crawled to the four- poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.",3
“Here — ” Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog.,3
“Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of parchment?” he said.,3
"She was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library  the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin’s under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears.",3
"“Are you, you great ugly brute?” It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high-pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass, blood blossoming over his robes.",3
"“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,” boomed Aunt Marge.",3
"Listen, Harry — perhaps we should leave it here for tonight.",3
This was starting to seem impossible.,3
"Hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws.",3
"As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg.",3
There’s going to be loads of fog tonight.” Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.,3
"If he was helping Black, why didn’t he just finish me off then?” “Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind works,” hissed Snape.",3
"I really hoped she wouldn’t be fit, she’s had some problems with injuries.",3
"There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment.",3
"Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.",3
Harry kept glancing at the staff table.,3
"“I’m sure of it,” said Fudge shortly.",3
“Your father would have done the same for me.,3
Ron was on his feet.,3
Crack) Quite a few people screamed.,3
"“But ’s only a matter o’ time, i’n’t it, after Malfoy ...” “How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down.",3
"Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around.",3
"The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it.",3
“Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You- Know-Who was after them.,3
“You should be in bed — has he had any chocolate?” he asked Madam Pomfrey anxiously.,3
"Tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses.",3
"“Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat.",3
"“Hagrid, we can’t — ” “Well tell them what really happened — ” “They can’t kill him — ” “Go!” said Hagrid fiercely.",3
"The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs.",3
"Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action.",3
"“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking very angry.",3
This was getting more and more dangerous.,3
“I was a very small boy when I received the bite.,3
"...” Harry said, even more quietly.",3
"He might not get another chance — Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head, buried in a box.",3
"“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione.",3
Underbred.” Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers.,3
"There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning.",3
"Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.",3
"Hermione’s right, you just need a good defense.",3
"Nobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore.",3
"“I’m afraid not, Potter,” she said.",3
"A small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.",3
"Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.” A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble.",3
"While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices, so that the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom.",3
"...” “iVo!” “Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately.",3
"He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.",3
“Just come out — prototype — ” a square-jawed wizard was telling his companion.,3
...” Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew with his fathomless eyes.,3
He didn’t realize what had happened.,3
Snape ’s wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to Crookshanks.,3
"The witch’s eyes moved from Scabbers ’s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.",3
“He didn’t take his potion tonight!,3
"Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green sludge.",3
“How can I ever thank — ” “GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together.,3
"“Forgive me, Remus,” said Black.",3
"“I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.",3
Dad can usually get tickets from work.” This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.,3
"Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say anything to Ron — nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.",3
"By the look of the grass stains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off.",3
"It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which one he preferred; the hippogriff’s wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didn’t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings.",3
“They’re dead and listening to echoes of them won’t bring them back.,3
He had never received a birthday card in his life.,3
"Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry’s bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.",3
"“You fell off,” said Fred.",3
"There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus vanished along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he’d just run a mile, and felt his legs shaking.",3
“Perce — Sirius Black!” said Ron faintly.,3
"Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on the Quidditch field .",3
He advised them to go into hiding.,3
"Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening.",3
"“Lucky the ground was so soft.” “I thought he was dead for sure.” “But he didn’t even break his glasses.” Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever.",3
Dreaming about having your own bedroom?,3
They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view.,3
“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge.,3
"“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — ”  “Please, sir, we’ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,” said Hermione quickly, “and we’re just about to start — ” “Be quiet,” said Snape coldly.",3
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door, the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.",3
"After a pause, Hermione said timidly, “Is it awful in there, Hagrid?” “Yeh’ve no idea,” said Hagrid quietly.",3
"Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third, which appeared to be unconscious.",3
He looked ill and exhausted.,3
They didn’t seem to understand at all.,3
"“We’d never be allowed ... ’specially you, Harry.",3
"The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.",3
"Harry, who didn’t want Fred and George asking him whether he’d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed  straight for his bedside cabinet.",3
"“He got very angry when she wouldn’t let him in, you see.” Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from  between his own legs.",3
"“Ron, how can you let him go with you?",3
"“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of background information — the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and — ” “Jordan!” “Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor heading for goal ...” Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely.",3
"“You shouldn’t have done that,” said Black, looking at Harry.",3
"The man was hurrying across the grounds, toward one of the entrances.",3
It was the Marauder’s Map.,3
"And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.",3
She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.,3
The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze.,3
Do you really think he’s going to worry about attacking Harry just because we’re there?” She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s basket as she spoke.,3
Why hadn’t it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too?,3
"You have nothing to feel ashamed of.” “When they get near me — ” Harry stared at Lupin’s desk, his throat tight.",3
"At last, the carriage swayed to a halt, and Hermione and Ron got out.",3
"... Well ... is there anything else I can help you with?” “Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need Unfogging the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.” “Ah, starting Divination, are you?” said the manager, stripping off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a corner devoted to fortune-telling.",3
“Ill go and meet them.,3
...” But Harry could tell Hermione didn’t really believe what she was saying.,3
“Like you told — ” “Can anyone confirm that?” Harry didn’t say anything.,3
“This potion is the only thing that helps.,3
"He, too, began rolling up his sleeves.",3
“What are you doing?” said Harry curiously.,3
"“Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked excited.",3
"“Do you remember who his best friend was?” “Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh.",3
"Harry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.",3
Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him.,3
"He doesn’t have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close — Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the hangings were hiding him from view.",3
"Once Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to exercise a lot of self- control not to spend the whole lot at once.",3
Dementors outside his door day and night.” “But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said Madam Rosmerta.,3
"Well, that’s all, you may leave.” “Ask her now,” Ron hissed at Harry.",3
Today’s will be a practical lesson.,3
...” He looked sober and tired.,3
"Come on — and keep your wand out — ” They covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail.",3
"“Ouch!” The book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still scuttling on its covers.",3
"“Scary-lookin’ fing, inee?” said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.",3
"Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases (“it’s a lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?”) or else discussing the case of Sirius Black (“personally, I won’t let any of the children out alone until he’s back in Azkaban”).",3
"“We should’ve known!” Ron roared, pounding the table.",3
An’ you know what Black did then?” Stan continued in a dramatic whisper.,3
"“I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it admirably.”  Neville’s face went, if possible, even redder.",3
I have never hurt a hair of Harry’s head!,3
"As Percy  hoped to enter the Ministry of Magic, he needed top grades.",3
Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the time.,3
"Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.",3
Didn’t people always say  that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of?,3
He spoke quite rationally to me.,3
Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten?,3
"“Ah, Severus,” said Lupin, smiling.",3
"Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front doors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors.",3
"It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the clatter of knives and forks.",3
“This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic.,3
The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.,3
"“And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.” No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson.",3
because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus.,3
Harry and Ron looked at her.,3
will set out ... to rejoin ... his master.,3
"“Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood.",3
“It’s a letter from my godfather.” “Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon.,3
"“You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms.",3
“Er — ” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers.,3
"Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward.",3
...” Harry avoided Black’s eyes.,3
"Everyone’s eyes were now on Lupin, who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale.",3
"Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney’s words still resounding in his head.",3
"The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything.",3
"His heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick Servicing Kit.",3
"Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.",3
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk.,3
"Harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he changed his mind; he didn’t feel like working.",3
"He had several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose.",3
Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared.,3
"The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too, disappeared into the gap in its roots.",3
"It couldn’t be the Grim — not now — not right before the match — He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute’s frantic searching, spotted it.",3
"I heard things in Azkaban, Peter.",3
"...  A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth .",3
He looked back at Sirius’s letter.,3
And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts ... to where Harry was.,3
Stan was watching Harry’s stunned face with great enjoyment.,3
"Harry went right after Black, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling.",3
"Aunt Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs.",3
"Dear Hermione, We lost I’m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.",3
"“Yes!” Ron yelled, yanking Harry’s arm into the air.",3
"... A little disappointing ... but I’m sure you did your best.” Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.",3
Harry thought ... What scared him most in the world?,3
“His front paw ...” “What about it?” said Ron defiantly.,3
"“He can’t just sit there on his own, waiting for the executioner!” “Sunset, though,” said Ron, who was staring out the window in a glazed sort of way.",3
He was now being closely watched.,3
“He bit Goyle for us once!” Ron said miserably.,3
I’ll never get another shot at it.,3
The opportunity was too perfect to miss.,3
"He couldn’t like Professor Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class.",3
Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a newspaper clipping.,3
"""... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious trouble,” he finished.",3
...” Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt.,3
He was lying flat on his back on the floor.,3
“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” Harry asked Ron.,3
"“My boy, you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic!",3
"Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face.",3
"Seriously.” The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever.",3
"Okay, so we’ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries — then the tournament getting called off last year.",3
"We must win!” “Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, looking slightly alarmed.",3
"“There’s only one vacancy, isn’t there?",3
"And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from Hogwarts.",3
There are parts of it even I don’t understand!,3
"“Er — stranger than usual, you mean?” “Yes .",3
"“Professor Snape ... hmmm ... Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?” “Er — yes,” said Neville nervously.",3
"“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry.",3
Who was Lupin talking about?,3
"Look at his hair!” He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon.",3
"“LOOK!” he bellowed, striding over to Hermione’s table.",3
Harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it — it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there.,3
"The owls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (“Local Deliveries Only”), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry’s hand.",3
He recognized Peter for what he was right away.,3
Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin playing along with him?,3
"Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.",3
"Harry, however, thought Lee had a point.",3
"“Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than understand — ” “I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog into his mouth.",3
"“Shall we proceed?” They set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with increased respect.",3
"“As for you two ... you’ll be staying here until I’m satisfied you’re — Potter, what do you think you’re doing?” Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his wand.",3
Harry tried hard not to blink.,3
“I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent.,3
"... You found him inside yourself.” And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused thoughts.",3
"“Right then, Neville,” said Stan, clapping his hands, “whereabouts in London?” “Diagon Alley,” said Harry.",3
"Each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection, giving the Firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precision.",3
"“Hermione, why didn’t you come to Charms?” “What?",3
“Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair.,3
"“You’ll have to kill all three of us!”  “There’ll be only one murder here tonight,” said Black, and his grin widened.",3
"He wasn’t happy about it, but he agreed.” “Not happy?",3
"From inside the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans.",3
An’ yeh shouldn’ be down here anyway.,3
Was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him?,3
"One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin black mustache.",3
A powerful one.” “But who conjured it?”  Harry didn’t say anything.,3
"This isn’t justice!” “Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go saying things like that to his boss!” said Hermione, but she too looked very upset.",3
"Then he said in a quiet voice, “What else, m’dear, but Sirius Black?",3
"He spun around, the familiar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were encircling them.",3
"LETTIN’ HIM!” Hagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the door.",3
"... And that’s how we came to write the Marauder’s Map, and sign it with our nicknames.",3
"— Ouch — sorry — ” “Hullo, Neville,” said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling Neville up by his cloak.",3
"“Now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is, they’re proud,” said Hagrid.",3
"“Nothing!” spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly.",3
You helped uncover the truth.,3
Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.,3
The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.,3
"It would have meant admitting that I’d betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I’d led others along with me ... and Dumbledore’s trust has meant everything to me.",3
"They were halfway toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that made his heart turn over — a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the darkness.",3
"He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes.",3
"Beaky, yeh clever boy!” Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to Hagrid.",3
"Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn.",3
The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle Vernon’s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.,3
A bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her.,3
"“YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B — ” Professor McGonagall didn’t even bother to tell him off.",3
Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips.,3
"They’re excellent.” The first-year boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by Dumbledore, and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands.",3
"Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay, Lupin said, “From what the headmaster told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry.",3
"followed by the unconscious Snape, drifting weirdly upward.",3
"“Yeh’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry’s neck.",3
"People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk.",3
"They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, “Somebody get Professor Dumbledore.",3
"“We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,” said Ron, sitting back down.",3
"They waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform.",3
“I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again.,3
"...” Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized.",3
"“Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster!",3
There was no one outside.,3
"They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (“Flibbertigibbet”), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room.",3
"“Well, well, well, I never thought I’d meet a third -year class who wouldn’t even recognize a werewolf when they saw one.",3
“The Shrieking Shack was never haunted.,3
... Scabbers had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks .,3
"Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug?",3
"“ There you are, Harry,” said a voice.",3
"He, Ron, and Hermione had gone ... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back door.",3
"Pat his beak, go on!” Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it.",3
"“If you knew my dad, you must’ve known Sirius Black as well.” Lupin turned very quickly.",3
"Ron came back five minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.",3
Hermione swayed on the spot.,3
"“And the same to you, sir!” roared Sir Cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them.",3
"And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door opened, and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid.",3
"The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry’s parents’ wedding.",3
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward.,3
"yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he’d lost consciousness.",3
"“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over and snatching Harry’s cup from him.",3
A list of books for next year is enclosed.,3
"She delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn’t got a present too.",3
"You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there’s no sense in them ... but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed.",3
"... “Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.",3
"“He’d be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone!” But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn’t help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of his life.",3
"“Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately!” said Ron, astounded.",3
"We were young, thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.” “I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore’s trust, of course ... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others’ safety.",3
"He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione.",3
I remember him offering to be the Potters’ Secret-Keeper himself.” “He suspected Black?” gasped Madam Rosmerta.,3
"But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter.",3
"The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked like a skull.",3
"Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak.",3
Harry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too.,3
"If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn’t it light him up?",3
"...” He, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black.",3
"“All righ’, you three?” Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd.",3
"“What’s Snape got to do with it?” “He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin heavily.",3
"“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece.",3
It was in the Daily Prophet this morning.,3
"“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or not!” said Harry, taking even himself by surprise.",3
Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game.,3
"“Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out.",3
"Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but no one else collapsed every time they went near one.",3
The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly.,3
They were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle.,3
It is very painful to turn into a werewolf.,3
Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number.,3
The three of them stood transfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak.,3
"“An odd place to meet — ” To Harry’s immense disquiet, Snape’s black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.",3
"“Well, get back to your common room where you belong!” snapped Filch, and he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.",3
"Never notice nuffink, they don’.” “Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,” said Ern.",3
And any other student would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such danger.,3
No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents.,3
He hadn’t seen his father — he had seen himself — Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.,3
“At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts.,3
"But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.",3
The rat was wriggling madly.,3
"Harry’s stomach turned over — Dumbledore would know exactly what had happened, if Malfoy said anything — Back into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone floor, through the trapdoor — Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.",3
"They’d never want you to go looking for Black!” “I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I’ve never spoken to them,” said Harry shortly.",3
"Harry felt very sick; when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.",3
Aunt Marge’s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle Vernon’s drills.,3
"“I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning in his voice.",3
"But before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart - Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind.",3
It was half past four.,3
“WHAT DID YOU DO?” “Professor Snape!” shrieked Madam Pomfrey.,3
You’ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt!,3
"It’s about to go!” “He’s coming, Molly!” said Mr. Weasley but he turned back to Harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice.",3
"At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.",3
"This house” — Lupin looked miserably around the room, — “the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use.",3
I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year.,3
"“The hippogriff might get off!” Before Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors behind him.",3
“HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM?,3
"“We’re supposed to be your friends.” “I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone,” said Hermione severely.",3
"I am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in.",3
“Leave Scabbers alone.” The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room.,3
"“Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar.",3
“Bin cooped up too long.,3
"Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?” “Of course not!” said Madam Pomfrey, bristling.",3
"Same time next week?” “Okay,” said Harry.",3
"Ron, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.",3
"Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off silently around Hagrid’s house.",3
"Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes.",3
"“It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,” he said quietly.",3
"He raised his wand, ready, but —  “Here!” shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward.",3
"A terrified excitement shot through him — any moment now — “Come on!” he muttered, staring about.",3
Then he whirled his wand at the dementors.,3
Did Black mean what he thought he meant?,3
"When Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story.",3
“Er — ” Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s back.,3
Hope the Muggles are treating you right.,3
"Anxious to catch up with it, he sped up, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry.",3
Harry and Ron choked back laughs.,3
"“How’re we supposed to get up there?”  As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a silvery ladder descended right at Harry’s feet.",3
"“I told you not to help him, Miss Granger.",3
"“Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?” “ ’Spect it will,” said Harry heavily.",3
"“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.",3
It was confiscated.” And he explained all about how the Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes.,3
"What was it they said ’ad ’appened, Ern?” “Gas explosion,” grunted Ernie.",3
"“So!” said Snape, his long nostrils quivering.",3
"“Mine still had a spout for a tail, what a nightmare.",3
"It’s enough to frighten anyone to death.” But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a black dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes.",3
"“Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and — ” “Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.",3
"The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.",3
"“He’s retired now, good for him to have something to do.",3
“Think about what you are saying.,3
"And Filch knows all the secret passages, they’ll have them covered.",3
"Expecto patronum).” Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground, pale as death.",3
"She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as magnificent as ever.",3
"Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.",3
"“ ’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper!” Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch’s whistle.",3
"“Because Black’s not worth dying for,” said Ron.",3
raising his hand to pat it .,3
"The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer.",3
"“Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a chance to tip Ron off before Snape saw him.",3
"Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an’ yeh wait.",3
"“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred.",3
"but he shouldn’t think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn’t want to ... or did he?",3
"Then, without warning, all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.",3
"“Move along there, Weasley.” Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from the chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up the marble staircase, and along a corridor.",3
“Definitely an owl?” Crookshanks purred.,3
"Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window.",3
"Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin!",3
... Harry began to run.,3
"“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.” Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore ’s back was to him, but he could see Percy’s face, rapt with attention, and Snape ’s profile, which looked angry.",3
"But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic hands, inviting Harry to read on.",3
I never meant it to happen.,3
It was circling around him and Black and Hermione.,3
"“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered.",3
"“Does he have to eat that in front of us?” said Ron, scowling.",3
"“Go quick,” he said hoarsely.",3
"“There’s another one in the cupboard,” Hagrid said, sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve.",3
“Here we come!” Hermione whispered.,3
"“I’ve already had some,” said Harry.",3
"“I’ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic.” He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, carried it away up the boys’ staircase.",3
"Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him.",3
"She’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.” The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist that they all go to bed.",3
"“I don’t know how I did it,” he said slowly.",3
"And a lasting injury like this” — he gave a huge, fake sigh — “who knows if my arm’ll ever be the same again?”  “So that’s why you’re putting it on,” said Harry, accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger.",3
"You always liked big friends who’d look after you, didn’t you?",3
“I certainly believe his master’s defeat unhinged him for a while.,3
"“PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!” Professor McGonagall stared at him.",3
"“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him.",3
I knew him at once .,3
He’d be welcomed back with honors.,3
"“Sirius, you’d better go, quick,” Harry panted.",3
As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry aside; the dog’s jaws fastened instead around Ron’s outstretched arm.,3
"Can I ask you something?” “Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile.",3
"“Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest.",3
"“Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, “they’ve messed up your schedule.",3
"“Forward, Neville, and finish him off!” said Lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach.",3
"You must catch the Snitch only if we’re — ” “I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled.",3
"“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white.",3
Large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off entirely.,3
"“But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew ... it just can’t be true, you know it can’t ...” “Why can’t it be true?” Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows.",3
“That was still really dangerous!,3
“Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the seventh floor.,3
"He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with absolutely nowhere to go.",3
"Just stick out your  wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go.",3
"Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now.",3
"Astounded, Harry bent over it.",3
"“So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt.",3
"“Well, really, I had to, don’t you know,” said an irritable Fudge.",3
"White an’ shakin’, he was.",3
"Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it.",3
"Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said, “RiddikulusV’ almost lazily.",3
"“Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an’ see me, I really — ” Hagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he’d only just realized he was there.",3
Her eyes started to roll.,3
"Father’s got a lot of influence, you know.",3
"Long as they’ve got a couple o’ hundred humans stuck there with ’em, so they can leech all the happiness out of ’em, they don’ give a damn who’s guilty an’ who’s not.” Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea.",3
"“ ‘As long as necessary, Wood’ ...",3
"Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the days became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake.",3
"“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron.",3
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold.",3
"If that wasn’t a happy memory, he didn’t know what was.",3
"“C’mon, now, get a move on!” he called as the class approached.",3
"“You’ll be a proper- sized man, Dudders, like your father.",3
"... Fighting to stay conscious, Harry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore.",3
"“Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic.",3
"...” Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black’s chest and settled himself there, right over Black’s heart.",3
He was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was absentmindedly swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand.,3
"I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn’t it?” Ron sighed exasperatedly.",3
"“Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school.",3
"Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.",3
"The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd.",3
"Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back hopelessly.",3
...” He told them all about the goblet.,3
"...” Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, “On the other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt.” He gave Harry’s broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, “Okay, everyone, let’s go And at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the ground.",3
"And Harry’s still with us because he’s not stupid enough to see one and think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!” Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new Arithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.",3
"“Well ... when you fell off, it got blown away,” said Hermione hesitantly.",3
"Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, “Shh!” She was watching Lupin very intently.",3
"“Oh, my — ” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm.",3
I passed out right afterward.,3
"None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him.",3
...” And then it hit him.,3
"Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, because he hadn’t called again.",3
"“Are you all right?” said Harry, moving closer to the picture.",3
"“Long time, no see.”  “S — Sirius ... R — Remus ...” Even Pettigrew’s voice was squeaky.",3
"“You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would’ve wanted to lure me out of school ... you said they’d have thought it was funny.” “And so we would have,” said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case.",3
Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.,3
"Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin’s hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling.",3
"He and Hermione were waiting, listening, their nerves jangling.",3
"“And I want to get him checked over,” he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them.",3
“How do we open our books?” Malfoy repeated.,3
"“That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid ’s first class, though, wasn’t it?” said Ron, looking worried.",3
I cannot make you take Sirius Black seriously.,3
"The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.",3
"They were emerging out of the darkness from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake.",3
"“He can go to Azkaban,” Harry repeated.",3
"Terrible though it was to hear his parents’ last moments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child.",3
"A second later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s leg.",3
I never betrayed James and Lily.,3
It is time somebody took this class in hand.,3
He glanced up at the sky.,3
"Stand aside, girl\” “Harry!”  Harry jerked back to life.",3
"“Your dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?” “Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it?” shrugged Ron, still chuckling.",3
"“Do you really think so, Severus?",3
“But there was only one dementor on the train.,3
"The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.",3
“GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!” Ron bellowed as Crookshanks ’s claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder.,3
The trick is to break his grip.,3
"...” He muttered, “Mobilicorpus.” As though invisible strings were tied to Snape’s wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position, head still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet.",3
"Here you are, Ron ... no, they’re not corned beef.",3
"Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match.",3
Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in Diagon Alley.,3
"Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.",3
"...” “Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry — ” Harry began awkwardly.",3
"“Careful, Weasley, careful!” cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes.",3
"Panting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn’t slow down until he reached the stone slide.",3
"She continued, however, as though she had not.",3
"Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.",3
His eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth.,3
"Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry.",3
"“Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?” said Hermione.",3
“Merry — hie — Christmas!,3
"...” “Now, this one here — ” She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench.",3
"Then, spotting Harry and Ron: “Good even, my fine young yeomen!",3
None of this  could have happened if I hadn’t been bitten ... and if I hadn’t been so foolhardy.,3
I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are.,3
"Go.’ But the dementor didn’t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away.",3
"It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn’t taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t be allowed to play on dragons.",3
Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.,3
"“Butterbeer!” said Harry, without thinking.",3
"Hermione’s there as well!”  Hermione nodded, beaming.",3
Harry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel.,3
"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty!” Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.",3
"“If we lose this match, we’re out of the running.",3
"You’ve got a very good friend somewhere, Potter.",3
Professor Lupin had come back.,3
"“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed.",3
"“Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em,” said Hagrid, as though this was the most obvious thing in the world.",3
He couldn’t hear the commentary over the wind.,3
"Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls’ dormitories and out of sight.",3
“You’ve got a Firebolti” said Ron.,3
He looked back at the map.,3
We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing.,3
"With a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice, he  said, “Oh, no — er — Professor,” then he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.",3
...”  “There’s still the appeal!” said Ron fiercely.,3
you’d think I’d said something terrible.,3
“Right — yeh can touch him!,3
There isn’t enough time.” “I’ll manage.,3
"She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn’t think had anything to do with nerves.",3
“He looks like he could do with some food.” Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously.,3
He’ll be sick as a pig!,3
“You’ll regret it if you don’t.,3
"He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley’s piggy face if he could see where Harry was now.",3
"Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle Vernon’s voice.",3
"It was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was lined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in midair.",3
“I let you sleep in my bed\” he said.,3
"“It is here, plainer than ever before ... my  dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer ... the Gr — ” “Oh, for goodness’ sake!” said Hermione loudly.",3
"The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley.",3
Something shiny glinted in his belt.,3
“I was just telling them all to get back to bed!,3
The name Professor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters.,3
"Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it was.",3
"“Right, it’s nearly time,” said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch.",3
A pair of feet was coming down the staircase.,3
“He’ll be in worse trouble if they know we’ve been to see him.,3
Ron checked his course schedule.,3
"“Please, let’s hurry,” Hermione whispered.",3
"And when he met me, he knew I was no dog.",3
"Thanks very much, Severus.” “Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn’t like.",3
“I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge’s visit.,3
"Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, where there was a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace.",3
...” She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach.,3
Won’t say no more here.,3
Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch.,3
"“That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley.",3
"“Thank you, Harry,” he said.",3
"How’re you supposed to be in three classes at once?” “Don’t be silly,” said Hermione shortly.",3
We’ve used it loads of times.,3
"If the crowd was cheering, they couldn’t hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder.",3
“Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.” “Excellent!” said Harry happily.,3
"“If Voldemort’s supporters were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy, Sirius Black!” Black’s face contorted.",3
"“I — I took him outside,” said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug.",3
Lying on your desk was a certain map.,3
"“D’you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry, checking his watch.",3
"There was a moment’s silence, then — “Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry bitterly.",3
"“Farewell!” cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some sinister-looking monks.",3
He brought it carefully inside.,3
"Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe ’s back.",3
"Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving.",3
It looked like the end of Ron and Hermione’s friendship.,3
"Muttering angrily to herself, she headed back to her office.",3
"“You don’t believe this ... wouldn’t Sirius have told you they’d changed the plan?” “Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,” said Lupin.",3
A livid bruise was rising around Black’s left eye and his nose was bleeding.,3
"“An extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it quiet from me.",3
"The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later  footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs.",3
"“Harry!” Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch.",3
It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real dementor.,3
"With a meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier.",3
"“He looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn’t he?",3
"“The Ministry’s providing a couple of cars,” said Mr. Weasley.",3
"“Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to .",3
"“Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.",3
"“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!” Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.",3
In the bed to his right lay Hermione.,3
But I couldn’t leave poor old Ripper.,3
"Before he’d had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down.",3
"“Ar, maybe she’s right,” said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who both staggered away, rubbing their ribs.",3
"“Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear.",3
Harry was shaking all over.,3
"“I think Divination seems very woolly,” she said, searching for her page.",3
"“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon’s large, purple face.",3
... It’s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused.,3
"“Are you all right, Harry?” Harry didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.",3
She went very red and muttered “hello” without looking at him.,3
Run\ I’ll hold him off~ The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a door bursting open — a cackle of high-pitched laughter — “Harry!,3
My mum ... trying to stop Voldemort killing me ... and you did that ... you did it.,3
"Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, this time from Hermione.",3
Him an’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London together.,3
The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night.,3
"Everyone had got to their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron’s table, pressing close to Professor Trelawney’s chair to get a good look at Harry’s cup.",3
"They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly.",3
Sounds like they think the double- crosser double-crossed them.,3
"“Hang on, there’s a P.S.",3
"On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her lip.",3
And don’t look at me like that” — Hedwig’s large amber eyes were reproachful — “it’s not my fault.,3
“Why’d you stop me?” said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for lunch.,3
"“Harry, you’ve got to come and stay with us.",3
"Macnair, you’re supposed to listen too, that’s procedure — ” Macnair’s face vanished from the window.",3
"“Third years at Hog — at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes,” said Harry.",3
"It is — ” he consulted his watch, “five minutes to midnight.",3
He heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall.,3
"Eyes open again, she looked around once more and said, “But where is dear Professor Lupin?” “I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said Dumbledore, indicating that everybody should start serving themselves.",3
Black’s been in Azkaban ever since.” Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.,3
They had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare Buckbeak’s defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds.,3
"As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward him.",3
"Instead of the usual display of gold- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters.",3
She was white as chalk.,3
“We should have stroked them!,3
"...” He looked at Harry, who did not look away.",3
"One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta’s glittering heels disappeared behind the bar.",3
"I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.",3
“They feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions.,3
His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first.,3
Hands were raining down on their backs.,3
"Midafternoon, just as it had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, they heard footsteps in the corridor again, and their three least favorite people appeared at the door: Draco Malfoy, flanked by his cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.",3
The third years had never had so much homework.,3
“That suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear.,3
He had a very strange dream.,3
But — no way — McGonagall or someone will give you permission — ” Harry gave a hollow laugh.,3
"“Well run for it,” said Harry determinedly.",3
"“Good day, my dear,” she said softly.",3
"Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.",3
"What if you’d given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?” “A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily.",3
"... Derek, have you had any of these chipolatas?",3
"They all think you’re dead, or you’d have to answer to them.",3
"“You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves.",3
"“There’s no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,” she said in a very serious voice.",3
"“It can’t have been a death omen,” he told his reflection defiantly.",3
“Will you be wanting anything?,3
"A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak.",3
The table went very quiet.,3
Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.,3
“Let the feast begin!” The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink.,3
Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.,3
"The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door.",3
Harry wasn’t surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.,3
Now nobody seemed to want to look at him.,3
"...  “They’re dead,” he told himself sternly.",3
"“It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day.",3
“I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight.,3
"“There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry up.",3
They’d have seen him fly in too.,3
"He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself.",3
"“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it.",3
"“You explain,” said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.",3
"I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and — and suck out his soul.” Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.",3
"“That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said Hermione.",3
then — “Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member.,3
"They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making company; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy.",3
"“Look, Harry still shouldn’t be coming into Hogsmeade.",3
“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously.,3
"“Er — how are the flobberworms?” “Dead,” said Hagrid gloomily.",3
"I have some doubt about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.",3
Ron and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other.,3
The minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.,3
"... Well, good luck!” She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.",3
“You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing?,3
"Two years at Hogwarts hadn’t taught them everything about the castle, and they had never been inside North Tower before.",3
"Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage.",3
"One of them, the large snowy female, was his own Hedwig.",3
"Thin cords shot from Lupin’s wand this time, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and gagged.",3
"You agree, Harry?” Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that Pettigrew could see him.",3
"When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off.",3
He looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the West Tower.,3
“It is five minutes to midnight.,3
"He could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.",3
"Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their wings.",3
A thought had just occurred to him.,3
"Black had proved twelve years ago that he didn’t mind murdering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.",3
Harry was watching the Slytherin table.,3
...” Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.,3
"Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes — he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.",3
"“Right — back away, now, Harry, easy does it — ” But then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.",3
...” He turned the teacup the other way up.,3
"“If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn,” said Professor Lupin.",3
He dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder’s Map.,3
"“And what are you two doing here?” said Snape, coming to a halt and looking from one to the other.",3
We haven’t visited him for ages!” “No!” said Hermione quickly.,3
Aunt Petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out.,3
George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers.,3
"“Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest.",3
Hermione poked her head around the door.,3
"“They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!” screamed Aunt Marge, swelling with fury.",3
“But this way it looks more like an acorn.,3
"They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes.",3
"“I’m going to see him,” he said to Ron and Hermione.",3
"“Haven’t you done enough damage this year?” Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks leapt onto her lap.",3
"Poor Neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him.",3
"“First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor Trelawney — ” Hermione looked rather flattered.",3
TEN-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!” Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight — “OUCH!” Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her.,3
"But the dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face.",3
"“Great,” said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin to try and see outside.",3
"January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the bitterly cold weather.",3
"“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated.",4
"“No, no, Vi, it’s the password,” said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.",4
Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic.,4
"He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside — Hermione, followed closely by Ron.",4
"Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament ... well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.",4
Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in Hagrid’s cabin.,4
"Hagrid was soon yelling, “Don’ panic, now, don’ panic!” while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes.",4
"“Oh hello, Harry,” said Percy.",4
Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress.,4
We managed to subdue him just in time.,4
"He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.",4
Harry was relieved to see that she wasn’t giggling.,4
"“I said, bow,” Voldemort said, raising his wand — and Harry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.",4
"...”  “But why, Bertha,” said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, “why did you have to follow him in the first place?” “Bertha?” Harry whispered, looking up at her.",4
What happened then?” “Killed Cedric ... they killed Cedric.,4
"He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail.",4
"“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?” Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky.",4
"He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.",4
"I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts — ” But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.",4
He wanted Sirius to stay.,4
“I was under my father’s control.,4
Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.,4
"“Yes, Master ...” “We will, Master.",4
"“It’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff — as you ought to remember.",4
"I know it’s not your fault,” she added quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously.",4
"Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket.",4
Moody was still gazing at the map.,4
He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn’t come out of the Goblet of Fire.,4
"“Potter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,” she said.",4
"“How’re you doing, Harry?” said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers.",4
“I’m sorry — I didn’t mean to — I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet — I — where are we?” But Dumbledore didn’t move or speak.,4
"What country?” “Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.",4
"Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing.",4
"They told him they ’d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window.",4
"Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud: Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.",4
"through the door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up.",4
He’s just outside the door.”  The door of the office opened.,4
Then he picked up a niffler.,4
"He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back safely.",4
“How did she get it?,4
"Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything  else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.",4
"“I bet Krum can see right through him, though ... bet he gets people fawning over him  all the time.",4
"“I’m not doing the task, I don’t know how — ” “Harry Potter will do the task!” squeaked the elf.",4
"... What wouldn’t he have given to be one of these people, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework?",4
“I told you not to annoy Rita  Skeeter!,4
How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen?,4
“Let’s Stun her for a bit.,4
“We sent it.”  Harry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep in Ron’s room when he was being shaken awake by Mrs. Weasley.,4
Hermione made a loud tutting noise.,4
Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.,4
So Bagman had to run for it.,4
"Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would drown one day, hadn’t bothered to give him any.",4
"The walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling.",4
“ Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated.,4
"This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration.",4
"He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort’s whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard.” “So they’re dead?” said Harry quietly.",4
"There were plenty of animals he wouldn’t want to kiss; his immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but something told him that wasn’t the answer.",4
"And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.” He stared at Sirius.",4
"“We told you to destroy them!” said Mrs. Weasley furiously, holding up what were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees.",4
except when they shrieked in their sleep.,4
What did these things mean?,4
"He had no family — no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway.",4
"I’m not complaining or anything” — he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside — “but I’m aching all over.",4
Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall.,4
"“What do they want photos for, Colin?” “The Daily Prophet, I think!” “Great,” said Harry dully.",4
"First Harry, then Hagrid “You don’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,” said Ron nervously.",4
“He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.,4
"Madam Pomfrey examined Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while.",4
"He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided.",4
They didn’t pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils.,4
"Entering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner.",4
"“The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe.",4
Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.,4
"Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, “Potter, the champions and their partners — ” “What partners?” said Harry.",4
The wizened witch started whispering in his ear.,4
He had put a hand on Harry’s shoulder.,4
“It’s a potion for dreamless sleep.” Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls.,4
"He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high- ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, “Harry Potter, sir!",4
I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.” “But for filth like this ...” Moody said softly.,4
"The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl.",4
"“My dear Madame Maxime,” he said.",4
"The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.",4
"They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.",4
"Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone ... feeble and powerless.",4
"...” “Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will you shut up for a bit, please?",4
The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape.,4
"For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?” “You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried.",4
“How was she doing it?” said Harry at once.,4
He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney’s room with his hands over his face.,4
"On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.",4
They kept practicing until past midnight.,4
"“What — what are you doing?” said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret’s progress through the air.",4
"There’s some who’d always hold it against yeh ... there’s some who’d even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an’ say — I am what I am, an’ I’m not ashamed.",4
Harry and Ron grinned at each other.,4
“Me and Hermione helped.”  Moody grinned.,4
“I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth.,4
"Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke- blackened brick behind her.",4
"Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.",4
And you don’t have to do end-of- year tests either.,4
"“Dumbledore ’s?” “That’s right,” said Harry.",4
"“Neville.” Neville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.",4
They said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door.,4
"Harry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed.",4
"“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily.",4
Phrases jumped out at him: hasn’t been seen in public since November ... house appears deserted ... St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment .,4
"Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron, “And you too — you ’elped — ” “Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a bit — ” Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him.",4
"I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon’s eyes are its weakest point — “That’s what Krum did!” Hermione whispered — but your way was better, I’m impressed.",4
"“Are you saying he was involved in — ” “Nah,” said George gloomily.",4
"Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned.",4
"...” “There are those who’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,” Moody retorted in a menacing voice.",4
"Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces.",4
"“Never — do — that — again — ” said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again.",4
"There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley’s usual package, including a  new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it — Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.",4
You need to be alert and watchful.,4
He was slightly duck- footed and distinctly round-shouldered.,4
"Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering.",4
"She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear?",4
"“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly.",4
"Meant a fair old bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they’d left behind.",4
"“Ah yes, so it is.",4
... Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species.,4
It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.,4
"He was torturing Wormtail ... you know who Wormtail — ” “I do know,” said Dumbledore promptly.",4
"“And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here.” He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them.",4
"Both of us suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers.",4
He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.,4
"As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.",4
"“It seems he has been responsible for several deaths!” “But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore.",4
"“The second task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter “Ten minutes?” Harry croaked.",4
"It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face.",4
"She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at Hogwarts.",4
"“Have it your own way, Potter,” said Malfoy, grinning maliciously.",4
There were two more questions he was burning to ask .,4
“But they get paid?” she said.,4
"Someone’ll come and collect him ... otherwise he’ll probably be eaten by a skrewt.” “He’d deserve it,” Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the spot where he lay.",4
Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt.,4
Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn’t reacted at all.,4
"“You know her — just put in loads of misery, shell lap it up.” “Right,” said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire.",4
"However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn’t about to tell the room about it.",4
"“ Dumbledorel” cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight — but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita’s clawed  fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag.",4
"“Er — but maybe this is not the time ... no ...” said Dumbledore, “where was I?",4
"To some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating.",4
That’s what I’ve got to teach you to fight.,4
"I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won’t answer.",4
"You can’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!” Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes.",4
Your name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident.,4
"“No, it’s just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?” Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron’s eyes.",4
"...” One of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle.",4
“Stay here.”  He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid ’s cabin.,4
"“Will you please inform zis ’Agrid zat ze ’orses drink only single-malt whiskey?” “It will be attended to,” said Dumbledore, also bowing.",4
"I’m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.” Harry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling Percy “Weatherby” yet, but resisted the temptation.",4
Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument.,4
"But next moment Harry had  begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys’ living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames.",4
Her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable.,4
"Harry’s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “water” on a page, but more often than not it was merely “Take two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt ...” “I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly from the other side of the table.",4
It had sucked his soul out through his mouth.,4
"The tips of Dumbledore ’s long, thin fingers  were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought.",4
"“Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.” Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.",4
"Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction — Karkaroff’s face was burning.",4
"“So,” said Ron, “d’you reckon he’s somewhere in Hogsmeade?” “Could be anywhere,” said Moody, shaking his head.",4
It was like waking from a deep sleep.,4
"The following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.",4
"“Well — yeah,” said Harry, casually.",4
Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.” “Crouch’s son was caught?” gasped Hermione.,4
He twisted around and looked at his bare feet — they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he had sprouted flippers.,4
"“I really hope you get it, Angelina!” “Thanks, Hermione,” said Angelina, smiling at her.",4
"“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,” said Hermione thoughtfully.",4
“It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament.,4
"Your father’s got some for smart parties!”  “I’ll go starkers before I put that on,” said Ron stubbornly.",4
"The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself.",4
"Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.",4
"He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards.” The insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.",4
“Why didn’t they bring cloaks?” “Over here!,4
Chop chop!” Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody.,4
"Riddikulusl” There was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke.",4
Harry could tell Cedric didn’t believe him.,4
"Chuck ’em straigh’ in the fire.” “You missed a really good lesson,” Harry told Hermione as they headed back toward the castle.",4
"From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric’s arm — “Stand aside!",4
"“Yeah, okay,” said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric.",4
"A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.",4
"He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters!",4
“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly.,4
“He’s got it — Krum’s got it — it’s all over!” shouted Harry.,4
"“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting up the path.",4
"Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes.",4
Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room.,4
"“Ah, excellent, lunch!” They were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when Mr. Weasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding  toward them.",4
"“Yes, I surmised as much,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling.",4
"He died about a year after they brought him in.” “He died?” “He wasn’t the only one,” said Sirius bitterly.",4
"More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection.",4
"“Help me, Harry,” he muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart.",4
"“I wonder why he’d do that?” “Says he’s taken a liking to me,” said Harry.",4
I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.” She looked down the list they had made in the library.,4
"“Acciol” Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup.",4
“Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party.,4
But then something rather unfortunate happened.,4
“But they are entombed in Azkaban.,4
He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before.,4
"As if!” said Ron, picking up one of the remaining Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into a pulp.",4
"“What were they talking about?” “You’ll find out soon enough,” said Mr.Weasley, smiling.",4
"“No, really!” said Mr. Weasley desperately.",4
And then — nothing could have prepared Harry for this — he felt his feet lift from the ground.,4
"Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves.",4
"Unlike full-grown unicorns, they were pure gold.",4
"The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts.",4
"“It definitely didn’t sound like an elf.” “Yeah, it was a human voice,” said Ron.",4
Come and sit over here!” Ron hissed.,4
GO back wherE you cAMe from mUGgle.,4
"“Professor,” Harry said at last, “do you think he’s getting stronger?” “Voldemort?” said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve.",4
"Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape’s greasy head — And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s thoughts.",4
"“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie.",4
“Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower.,4
According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch .,4
"There were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness of Bartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still Missing — Minister of Magic Now Personally Involved.",4
It was much too dark to make out his expression.,4
"They were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak.",4
"The journey has tired me greatly.” Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard.",4
"It wasn’t Dobby — it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry’s friend Dobby had been.",4
"But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.",4
It had seven keyholes in a row.,4
"He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.",4
"“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the darkness.",4
"Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by  Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion- making kit — he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna.",4
"The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes.",4
“You’ve got a space up by the wood there.,4
"“You told me about the dragons,” Cedric said.",4
"“It will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!” “Dobby,” said Harry frantically, “listen — are you sure about this?” He couldn’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to “help” him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm.",4
"“Caught with the guilty wand in your hand\” “Amos,” said Mr. Weasley loudly, “think about it ... precious few wizards know how to do that spell.",4
Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from?,4
"For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed.",4
Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort.,4
"“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred.",4
He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead.,4
“Put them together ... it’s not that difficult.,4
"I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I’ve kept quiet.",4
"“It’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can correct it — ” But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley’s tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.",4
"He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.",4
They can’t all be horrible.,4
"Percy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.",4
"... Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something?” “Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively.",4
"Mulciber — he specialized in the Imperius Curse, forced countless people to do horrific things!",4
I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our  impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.” His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces.,4
"The Weasleys were Harry’s favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.",4
"“Well ... when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were,” she said.",4
"“OUCH!” said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head.",4
It had paintings of  merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid.,4
...”  Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder.,4
"Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the  spider’s underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted “Stupefyl” just as Cedric yelled the same thing.",4
"Pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but Hermione paid no attention.",4
"Why he had to choose last night ...” “Never mind, Amos,” said Mrs. Weasley.",4
"Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire, the screaming filled Harry’s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he  was yelling too.",4
"“I sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind.” “Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort.",4
"Unwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night.",4
"She was sitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her knees.",4
"True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather.",4
"“Must be nice,” Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings.",4
"Over his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the wall.",4
"If he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now.",4
He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed.,4
Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father.,4
He was best at flying.,4
"...” “ ‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate ...’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it.",4
"And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!” “That’s not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky’s continued screaming and fist-beating.",4
“My sweet!” — Mrs. Norris was obviously with him — “This is a Triwizard clue!,4
"“ — into a beetle.” “You’re kidding,” said Ron.",4
“What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box?,4
“I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time.,4
He handed over his wand.,4
"I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark — ” “What, aren’t you staying?” Ron blurted out.",4
both of them were stirring.,4
"Nobody but themselves and Professor  Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.",4
"“What are you doing in here, all alone?” They looked at one another, surprised.",4
"“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.",4
Lunch was an almost silent meal.,4
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms.,4
"Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you’re about to find inside.",4
Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils.,4
Harry stopped to let him walk through first.,4
"He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side.",4
"“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?” she said angrily.",4
Wheeeeeeeeee!” And he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived.,4
"Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn’t catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.",4
“One ...” (he put down a finger) “two ...” (he put down a second one) — They scattered.,4
“How d’you reckon they’re coming?,4
“He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.” “What?” said Ron and Hermione together.,4
"The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard.",4
"Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats.",4
"Ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W.",4
“Eau de cologne?” said Hermione in amazement.,4
"“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other.",4
“ Cruciol ” The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around.,4
His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart.,4
"Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her.",4
"All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck.",4
"That’s no reason to “Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.",4
It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age.,4
"It was as though the eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an equal — a real rival — “You haff never ... you haff not ...” “No,” said Harry very firmly.",4
"As Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted.",4
"He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.",4
"Stand back, Harry.” Harry retreated to the sofa.",4
His voice broke into petrified sobs.,4
"“Well, if they end up having children, they’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.” They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them.",4
"Rita Skeeter’s smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, “How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know, Harry?",4
"The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white.",4
"We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.",4
"“The elf wasn’t the only one in that box,” said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace.",4
"The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was “creepy.” Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.",4
"Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin.",4
"Potter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the  curse with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him).",4
I know some good ones now.,4
"Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua- Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.",4
His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum.,4
“Keep your voice down!” said Harry crossly.,4
That shut Harry and Ron up.,4
“Don’t you want to see what Percy’s written?” Harry asked her hastily.,4
And finally give me the sound often heard During the search for a hard-to-find word.,4
"Because Moody’s right, Harry ...",4
"All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them.",4
I mean — they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety.,4
"“But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped.",4
"could you give me the next clue again, please?” She repeated the next lines of the poem.",4
"“Be’er wait fer the Slytherins, they won’ want ter miss this — Blast-Ended Skrewts!” “Come again?” said Ron.",4
"And here’s your sweater.” He threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent.",4
"It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative.",4
He stared all around him.,4
"“I got some o’ those letters an’ all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou’ me mum.",4
"He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered.",4
"“The Ministry of Magic,” Dumbledore continued, “does not wish me to tell you this.",4
"...” “I don’t think he’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,” said Hermione seriously.",4
"This is Rita Skeeter,” he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes.",4
"You didn’t do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you — ” But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn’t hear a word, and screeched, “You is not insulting my master, miss!",4
"“I don’t show favoritism, me.",4
“Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good.,4
“What’s got Karkaroff all worried?” Ron muttered.,4
"Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form.” The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.",4
A few of the Hogwarts students laughed.,4
“Those people’s deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again.,4
"“You know it by heart, we can just ask you.” “All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things — they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there’s too much magic in the air.",4
"They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands.",4
"Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.",4
"A large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry’s chest into his stomach.",4
"“Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I’ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him.",4
The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.,4
"A nice little reunion for them,” he finished disgustedly.",4
"“He was a great Beater, though,” said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree.",4
"... Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown — he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches — any second now, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him “Filch?",4
"What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak?” “The Invisibility Cloak wouldn’t have got me over that line,” said Harry slowly.",4
"“Branstone, Eleanor!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” “Cauldwell, Owen!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” “Creevey, Dennis!” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid ’s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers’ table.",4
“It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!” Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing.,4
"At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside.",4
Off you go.” He pointed one gnarled finger toward the door.,4
"“Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly.",4
"“Come,” said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under Harry’s elbow.",4
The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work.,4
He said someone was dead.,4
"“Harry, you’ve got to come — you’ve got to come, the most amazing thing’s happened — please — ” She seized Harry’s arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.",4
"Roger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork.",4
"“What’s going on?”  “They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,” said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh.",4
... Bagman was shouting something  ... but Harry’s ears were not working properly anymore ... listening wasn’t important.,4
"“Isn’t he, Harry?” “Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry earnestly.",4
She took off the lid and showed them the contents.,4
"He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor him.” Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more.",4
"“Wormtail’s body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed.",4
"“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!” Dobby squeaked.",4
"Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces.",4
"“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,” said Snape viciously.",4
"He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn’t see what it was.” “He showed Snape something on his arm?” said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered.",4
"The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry .",4
“Then he’s hoping you’ll help him find out what his egg means!,4
"And — and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?” Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck.",4
"“You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?” “Yes,” said Hermione, “he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Tri-wizard Tournament.” “Mr.",4
He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore’s speech about Cedric.,4
"“When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments .",4
"“What happened to her?” “I have been busy, Ludo,” said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips.",4
"Because if you do, hang around ... they’re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.” “Hermione’s a witch,” Harry snarled.",4
"Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please ... let it drown.",4
"Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded.",4
“Imagine what I’d look like trying to dance with her.”  Hermione’s words about Krum kept coming back to him.,4
His insides had come back again.,4
I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago .,4
"Harry couldn’t get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks,  forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands.",4
"When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.",4
"I don’t suppose you’d like to give an interview, would you?",4
"“Yep,” said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half.",4
"Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music.",4
He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.,4
Where were the other champions?,4
"“I have given evidence already on this matter,” he said calmly.",4
"It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are.",4
"At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared.",4
Don’  open ’em if yeh get any more.,4
Twice he found himself facing dead ends.,4
His feet had left the ground.,4
"Ah, I see his  house-elf’s saving him a seat.",4
"...” Pretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron left the table, edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall.",4
the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen ... except that they weren’t — they couldn’t be — human.,4
Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee.,4
Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder.,4
the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life.,4
"When he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days.",4
Tell him from me I’ll swap any time he wants.,4
He really couldn’t think of anything to say.,4
but they concerned the guilt of living people.,4
"He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said “the Burrow!” His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley’s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python.",4
Mr. Crouch was telling me ...,4
"What’s he up to — trying to rescue the Muggles?” “Where’re your parents?” said Harry, his temper rising.",4
People had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.,4
"“Blood,” said Harry, raising his arm.",4
"There’s a Death Eater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end — ” Harry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down.",4
the last of the dragon-free hours?,4
There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else.,4
"A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other.",4
"Sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks.",4
"“What’s up with her?” said Ron, looking curiously after Winky.",4
"“Well, there you are!” said Bagman.",4
"He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort’s supporters.",4
"“We’ve got food, Harry, come and have some — ” “I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast — ” But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn’t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn’t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn’t at all in the mood to celebrate.",4
The Great Hall was normally decorated with the winning House’s colors for the Leaving Feast.,4
"bless them,” he added fondly, leading the way toward the  nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.",4
"“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.",4
"Aaaaaaand — Krum\” “That’s him, that’s him!” yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars.",4
"Convenient, eh?” Moody had just entered the room.",4
"“You won’t get them sick leave by starving yourself!” “Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose.",4
"Harry looked between them, then said, “Mrs.",4
"Harry swam on past the rock, following the mersong.",4
"Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake’s with slits for nostrils ... Lord Voldemort had risen again.",4
“Let him have a sleep.,4
"“Well, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle.",4
"“Tell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful .",4
More publicity.” “Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room.,4
Apparently his nerves couldn’t stand the sound of the word “broomsticks” in his living room.,4
Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other.,4
"But if you’re going to work against me — ” “The only one against whom I intend to work,” said Dumbledore, “is Lord Voldemort.",4
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt.,4
"“I bet he wishes he hadn’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she’s not there to look after him.”  “Hermione’s obsessed with house-elfs,” Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look.",4
"“You saved ’er,” she said breathlessly.",4
Her clothes were ragged and unwashed.,4
"Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment.",4
"The dementors — tall, hooded creatures whose faces were concealed — were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man’s arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands.",4
"“But Levski’s got the Quaffle!” “Harry, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed, you’re going to miss things!” shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field.",4
"“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be calm voice — but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.",4
"He kept glancing down at the map, wondering ...",4
"Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite.",4
“Think how many Canary Creams that is.” The twins stared at him.,4
"Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon’s grapefruit.",4
"Wear your dragon- hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.” Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying.",4
"Or our son, Draco?” “How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy.",4
“I reckon we should send up red sparks.,4
"“Dragon blood’s amazingly magical, but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?” Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard.",4
He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter’s article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was.,4
"“I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face.",4
And who had the old man been?,4
"“He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and then he named names ... he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place.",4
"Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police.",4
"“Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,” she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow.",4
"Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.",4
... I’ll give you excellent odds on that one.,4
"“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.",4
"C’mon, Harry.” They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle.",4
His hand gripped his wand under his robes.,4
"Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.",4
"“Couldn’t remember all the goblin rebels’ names, so I invented a few.",4
"Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.” “Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice.",4
"“Yeah, it does!” said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head.",4
"His dad’s got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup\ The letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig’s leg; she kept unusually still, as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave.",4
"Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?” “Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the — ”  “Write to Sirius.",4
“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione furiously.,4
"“What did Mr. Crouch say, Harry?” said Dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.",4
"The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from Sirius.",4
"“He’s ill, he’s injured — Dumbledore, Diggory’s parents, they’re here, they’re in the stands.",4
"Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem.",4
"...” But Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward.",4
"“Don’t let Malfoy get to you, Ron — ” “Him!",4
I’m back in the country and well hidden.,4
"“What does she mean, ‘the normal way’?” he spat.",4
He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand.,4
“Then Mr. Krum will enter ... then Miss Delacour.,4
"Harry caught it by the handle — He heard Voldemort’s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him.",4
“What is it?” Harry asked shakily.,4
“Who ’re you?” Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt’s sting and tightened it.,4
I took the map from Potter that night.,4
"Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village.",4
“Flee — I will make your excuses.,4
but we will give you time .,4
It looked like light made liquid — or like wind made solid — Harry couldn’t make up his mind.,4
"“Give it here.” Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper.",4
"The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed.",4
"“The person who conjured the Mark?” “No,” said Mr. Weasley.",4
"... “We bow to each other, Harry,” said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry.",4
"When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right — ” But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry’s face and didn’t speak again until they reached the  Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney’s predictions tonight, since they would take hours.",4
"Binding  magical contract, like Dumbledore said.",4
"“Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape — ” “Oh give it a rest, Hermione,” said Ron impatiently.",4
Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive.,4
"“Look at this,” he growled.",4
“I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school.” He left.,4
"Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione’s that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze.",4
His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim.,4
He can’t have been more than nineteen.,4
"Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.",4
"He knew, of course, that Dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man.",4
"Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth.",4
"“It’s all right, sonny,” he said to Neville.",4
"“It comes down to this,” said Hermione, rubbing her forehead.",4
"Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.",4
"It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle.",4
"“Three — two — one — ” He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze.",4
... Dunno if we’ve learned enough.,4
"She definitely arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin there.",4
“Master is — hie — trusting Winky with — hie — the most important — hie — the most secret — ” “What?” said Harry.,4
"But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair.",4
"That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her bewitched so she can’t even run when they start trampling tents!",4
"Well, that’s no mystery, is it?” blustered Fudge.",4
"“And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch Team!” yelled Bagman.",4
He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.,4
"“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said.",4
"The towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze.",4
"“No, I don’t like it,” Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma were sitting.",4
Harry was thinking of the way Crouch’s eyes had bulged as he’d looked down at his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup.,4
But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval.,4
"... Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could not remember the name .",4
"Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects.",4
"“I don’t know,” said Mr. Weasley.",4
"“Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!” he said.",4
"“It means that you are not a wizard.” “I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice growing steadier.",4
"Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor.",4
Up the marble stairs ... “The Dark Lord was there?,4
"He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry, Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.",4
“So do I!” said Hermione breathlessly.,4
“What exactly are you going to — ” BANG.,4
"“ This isn’t my fault.” If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was.",4
"As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.",4
"Then he said, “I hate being poor.” Harry and Hermione looked at each other.",4
"“The servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,” Voldemort continued.",4
"“Potter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.” “Please, sir — he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked Colin.",4
"... “You okay, Harry?” Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns.",4
"“And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?” He began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while.",4
"Another clap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating  the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings.",4
"Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.",4
"“And these were important supporters, mark you.",4
“Hermione — it’s the first day back!,4
“Crouch let his son off?,4
"However, Bill was — there was no other word for it — cool.",4
"I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped — “but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.” “Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?” said Harry, frowning.",4
A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred.,4
“You should never have brought it inside the castle!” yelled Professor McGonagall.,4
"The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue.",4
"I meant best.” Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.",4
"He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione.",4
"Broomsticks?” Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky.",4
"He had his supporters, mind you — plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic.",4
"“Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected — ”  “And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute?",4
The one with Crouch’s son?,4
"“Poor old Snuffles,” said Ron, breathing deeply.",4
"“And I answer myself,” whispered Voldemort, “they must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone.",4
"He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, “Rennervatel” Winky stirred feebly.",4
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament?,4
"Gentlemen ... lady,” he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three.",4
"“The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair down,” she said, in a disapproving voice.",4
"Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school’s secrets, and right to protect them?” “Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor,” said Dumbledore amicably.",4
"and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry.",4
He didn’t want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup.,4
...”  “Are you mad?” said Ron.,4
"Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape’s office, and Moody and Snape’s conversation.",4
"Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.",4
"The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.",4
Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour’s time if he needs me.” Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.,4
"He likes it much better here, he told me.”  Ron said nothing.",4
“Oh it’s so beautiful!” whispered Lavender Brown.,4
The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.,4
"“Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house.",4
"good lord, I thought she’d had it then!” Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more.",4
"A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father.",4
"“What’s that?” said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.",4
"“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words out.",4
Bring as much food as you can.,4
He staggered back to the cauldron with Harry’s blood.,4
"“No,” she said, continuing to pace.",4
"“Potter,” Moody growled, “you next.” Harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks.",4
The Creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggoryl badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter\ instead.,4
"“Oh hello, Harry, dear,” she said, spotting him and smiling.",4
"Draco Malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter’s article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it — and just to heighten Harry’s feeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet “She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,” Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term.",4
"Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.",4
And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place.,4
"“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.",4
"Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins?” “Ha, ha, ha,” said Hermione sarcastically.",4
"“I got told off for going in there,” said Harry, which was half-true; Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtle’s bathroom.",4
"One of them was small, dark, and beady.",4
"“Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards'.” Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror- struck by his own daring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, “ Bad Dobby !",4
Where is there enough work for two house- elves?’ says Winky.,4
"The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was.",4
He looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence.,4
She left him at the entrance of the tent.,4
If it hadn’t worked ... if it wasn’t coming ...,4
"There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.",4
"“Wait, I have more!” Harry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard.",4
"Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.",4
"There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart.",4
“How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?”  “Lasso one?” Ron suggested.,4
And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.,4
Cedric and Fleur were in conversation.,4
He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face.,4
Ron ... maybe you’d better tell Percy.,4
"...” “Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley.",4
"But when Krum’s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.",4
He wasn’t anywhere on there.” “So he did Disapparate?” said Ron.,4
What if he actually managed to win?,4
POTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room.,4
“Who’re you blackmailing?” he said.,4
“Foul!” echoed Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice.,4
"However, someone seems to be having a good try.",4
"He’s ill or something — he’s in the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore!",4
“What rules are they changing?”  But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved.,4
"“You’ll be Arthur Weasley’s son, eh?” Moody said.",4
"“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,” he snarled at once.",4
Harry recognized the tea towel at once.,4
"“Even though she was not your ’ostage.” “Yeah,” said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he’d left all three girls tied to the statue.",4
"“What d’you reckon it’s going to be?” he asked Harry as they went together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night.",4
My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me.,4
"Just the one night?” “That’s it,” said Mr. Weasley.",4
"More wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies.",4
"“Professor?” he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.",4
She gave Ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking.,4
"My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong.",4
...” “Cedric?” said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.,4
"Harry dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.",4
“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?” Ron said.,4
"“Potter can speak Parseltongue, ” reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year.",4
He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this.,4
You will return to Azkaban in the meantime.,4
"“ Cedric — Cedric Diggory.” He had been starting to quite like Cedric — prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone’s favorite champion.",4
"“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione.",4
"“Knows what it’s like to be out there doing it,” said George impressively.",4
"Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.",4
"An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.” “Imagining things, am I?” growled Moody.",4
“ Crucio \ ” The air was suddenly full of Cedric’s yells.,4
"“I’m your son!”  “You are no son of mine!” bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly.",4
"that stuff’s your thoughts?” Harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin.",4
You’re there.” But Cedric didn’t move.,4
"“Good day,” said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind Harry, making him jump.",4
"Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels.",4
Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?” “Yeh — yeh’re not half-giant!” said Hagrid croakily.,4
"“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand.",4
"...” “Come back and teach, Hagrid,” said Hermione quietly, “please come back, we really miss you.” Hagrid gulped.",4
"“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome — the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team!",4
...” “Alas tor!” said Dumbledore warningly.,4
"Harry felt as though Dumbledore’s speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow.",4
"“You do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved?” she kept saying fiercely.",4
"“Some Bulgarian ministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ...” “The Malfoys!” said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously.",4
"“Er — well ...” said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous.",4
"“Yer mum wouldn’ be happy, Ron,” said Hagrid, grinning.",4
Why did he have to go red now?,4
"Harry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed.",4
Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure- blood family as old as any — and see what that man chose to make of his life!,4
"“You couldn’t give us a moment, you two, could you?” “Er — okay,” said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.",4
“Don’t you want to go with him?” “Oh ... well ...” Hermione went slightly pink.,4
"Somebody inside the chimney piece said, “Shh!” “Mr.",4
"“I found her holding one, Ludo.",4
"He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen ... he had become Hogwarts champion ... he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming ... he had just won the Triwizard Tournament.",4
"...” Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy’s voice.",4
"“He returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour.",4
"Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong.",4
"No one spoke until the bell rang — but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth.",4
"“You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), “but I don’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers.",4
“He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail.,4
"“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,” she said seriously.",4
"They were now  leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.",4
“Ludo says Bertha’s perfectly capable of getting herself lost.,4
There was no hope ... no help to be  had.,4
Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can!,4
"“You all right, Neville?” Harry asked him.",4
"“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.” “I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now.",4
"He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn’t working too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table.",4
There was nothing in Madcap Magic for Wacky Warlocks .,4
I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter.,4
"Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again.",4
“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken — that we are all facing dark and difficult times.,4
"“Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?” Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all.",4
"“Just find him, all right?” Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall.",4
“If you’d rather learn the hard way — when someone’s  putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me.,4
“Couldn’t have a better spot!” said Mr. Weasley happily.,4
"If he told Harry he couldn’t go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated.",4
“Harry Potter!” he called again.,4
What are you best at?” Harry tried to concentrate.,4
"They didn’t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.” O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen.",4
Then he heard Ron yell with pain.,4
"I’ll have you, Peeves, I’ll have you, you’ll ... and what is this?” Filch ’s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped — Filch had picked up the egg and closed it.",4
"In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry.",4
"Harry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction.",4
"“Ah, I was forgetting ... you don’t like the dementors, do you, Albus?” said Moody with a sardonic smile.",4
"Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard’s robes.",4
"“No more has Professor Snape,” he said.",4
Dunno what happened to her ... might be dead fer all I know.,4
“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after them.,4
"Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above — although you may invite a younger student if you wish — ” Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle.",4
"dear, dear, Potter, what’s ailing you now?",4
They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley.,4
"“Myrtle!” Harry tried to shout — but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble.",4
"Madame Maxime was concentrating on her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked red.",4
"“Charlie wanted to come, but he couldn’t get time off.",4
"“And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!” as a boy went rushing after her.",4
Magnificent though the bathroom was — and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps — now he was here he couldn’t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on.,4
"“Told us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn’t giving us anything.”  “So we asked for our money back,” said George glowering.",4
“Don’t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid?,4
"Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head.",4
"...” He smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder.",4
“Everyone’s worst fear ... the very worst ...” There was silence for a moment.,4
"“No idea,” said Ron mulishly, looking up at him.",4
All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping.,4
"After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him.",4
Other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.,4
"There might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did.",4
Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him.,4
"... You are merciful, thank you.",4
He likes the quiet life.,4
...” The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north.,4
"“Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape’s been avoiding him.",4
"I mean, I don’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage.",4
"He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.",4
"“He’s seen it all,” said George.",4
He could hear the blood pounding in his ears.,4
"“It ’az been a pleasure meeting you!” Harry’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.",4
"“About Crouch and everything?” “No,” said Harry.",4
"“The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,” said Dumbledore.",4
"Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.",4
"“We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know, as they’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead,” said Bagman.",4
"Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took marks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any damage to them.” Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure.",4
"It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air.",4
"“He must be entering the tournament.” “That idiot, Hogwarts champion?” said Ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase.",4
"Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch.",4
"Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson.",4
"Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there.",4
"It’s never been this clear, never since — ” “Put it away!” snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.",4
"As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.",4
"Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron.",4
"Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak’s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them.",4
"Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years.",4
Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most fundamental instincts came into conflict.,4
"“Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins’s information, of course.",4
He knew what the dementor must have done.,4
"He heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him.",4
"Now string them together, and answer me this, Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?” Harry gaped at her.",4
"Avis'.” The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight.",4
"But in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains — ” “Now, now, Viktor!” said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn’t reach his cold eyes, “don’t go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us!” Dumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling.",4
"There was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus were lying in front of each of them.",4
"Oh Fred ... George ...”  “Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house.",4
"It was a good theory, but it wasn’t working very well.",4
"“Harry, he was a Death Eater.",4
It had a number three around its neck.,4
“Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?” Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle.,4
"He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it?",4
"The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around Wormtail’s neck, and Wormtail lifted it.",4
"“Death, my dears.” Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified.",4
“When I can’t ... when I haven’t ... not for ages ...”  She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly.,4
“The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who  understand the steps of the celestial dance.,4
"“Take them away!” Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth.",4
Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag.,4
His face wore a very ugly look indeed.,4
"When the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she seemed to be expecting something.",4
"“He’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard Tournament — you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.” “Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill.",4
“I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it.,4
"“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered.",4
"He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadows beyond, where the water became opaque.",4
"“I wasn’t accusing you, laddie.",4
"Harry wondered, as he sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.",4
The days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed.,4
Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words.,4
"... And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half- formed thoughts started chasing through Harry’s dazed mind.",4
"He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it... but he wasn’t going to play along.",4
"Weasley,” said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, “Hedwig hasn’t arrived with a letter for me, has she?”  “Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly.",4
"“Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures.” Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast- Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could, Harry didn’t know, but Hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d returned to work.",4
But Moody wasn’t watching them.,4
"“Off you go then, Fred,” said Mr. Weasley.",4
"“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione.",4
She seemed too appalled to speak.,4
"“It’s your friend ...” The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veela-girl.",4
Harry\” Harry opened his eyes.,4
The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts.,4
"No point pretending ... well ... come on, Longbottom, I’ve got some books that might interest you.” Neville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn’t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody’s gnarled hands on his shoulder.",4
"We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school.",4
"“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans.",4
"The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded- up fireplace burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings.",4
"“You take your own hostage,” one of them said to him.",4
"my faithful servant at Hogwarts ... Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail.",4
"“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled.",4
This gave Harry an idea.,4
He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.,4
"Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail’s bleeding wrist.",4
"“Vot is wrong with him?” “No idea,” Harry muttered.",4
"“I thought he was waiting for us!” Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.",4
"The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville’s usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake.",4
"It was, unmistakably, a younger Rita Skeeter.",4
"Gives ’em second chances ... tha’s what sets him apar’ from other heads, see.",4
"“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.",4
"Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.",4
"“This tournament’s famous, and you’re famous.",4
"Oh yeah ... ouch ... interesting,” said Harry as she stepped on his foot.",4
"Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle.",4
"“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could.",4
Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.,4
"Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody’s desk as possible.",4
but Krum was on his tail.,4
"We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup — ” “George!” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.",4
“We’ll tell Professor Sprout where you’ve gone.,4
"When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own.",4
The gargoyle did not move.,4
"When he saw Dumbledore, he tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.",4
"Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.",4
"“So,” said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon Winky, who was still shaking convulsively.",4
"If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated.",4
"“Hermione, Neville’s right — you are a girl.",4
I’m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch.,4
He was sure Cedric wouldn’t have asked that if he had seen the dragons  himself.,4
"“We’re seventeen in April, why can’t we have a shot?” “They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table.",4
"And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him.",4
"“A map of the campsite for you,” Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley.",4
“Not unless you can answer my riddle.,4
"Harry couldn’t answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat.",4
“What’re you two doing here?” Ron asked.,4
Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody.,4
"Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I’m not ashamed to admit it.",4
"Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry’s wand, and they looked scared.",4
"“I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve — but that was before carpets were banned, of course.” He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law.",4
"“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,” grunted a man at the bar.",4
“Where’s Dumbledore?” Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.,4
"... Madame Maxime’s staying to judge, isn’t she?” When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again.",4
He was pointing at Harry’s pillow.,4
"“What on earth did you give that Muggle boy?”  “I didn’t give him anything,” said Fred, with another evil grin.",4
"They went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly.",4
"Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen.",4
"Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.",4
"“It’s going to be boiling in Trelawney’s room, she never puts out that fire,” said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.",4
"Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn’t know.",4
“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father.,4
"Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.",4
I’d pay five Galleons for that!” Percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.,4
"“My name is Winky, sir — and you, sir — ” Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry’s scar.",4
"“Moody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!” said Professor McGonagall weakly.",4
Harry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day.,4
...” Both of Moody’s mismatched eyes widened.,4
Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining — surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves?,4
"His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.",4
I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night.,4
"“I’m warning you, Peeves — ” Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.",4
They hide out in mountains mostly.,4
My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts.,4
"“It’s mine — must’ve dropped it earlier — ” But Snape ’s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch’s arms to the map in Moody’s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only Snape could.",4
"“Never been this crowded,” he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field again.",4
"“Hedwig’s not going to manage that journey in a few days.” “Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.",4
"Turn ’round and face me like a man, why don’t you?” “But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames.",4
"Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?” “Balderdash,” said Harry dully.",4
"“Dumbledore, he ought to — look at him — he’s been through enough tonight — ” “He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,” said Dumbledore curtly.",4
Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy’s lip curl like that.,4
"It was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards.",4
"She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.",4
He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle.,4
"“What do they want?” Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching Bagman very closely.",4
"“And if he had any decency, he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.” But Frank did not leave.",4
Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way.,4
"“I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports,” said Ginny, looking surprised.",4
"“ The sound often heard during the search for a hard- to-find word,’ ” said Harry.",4
"“He was having real trouble stringing  two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do.",4
Dumbledore was going to question him.,4
"“Well, I’m a lot further on than I was.",4
"To their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts.",4
We’re not supposed to know.,4
“Hope they hurry up with the Sorting.,4
"I have seen it before, I recognize it!",4
Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light.,4
"...” “Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long.",4
"“We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,” Hermione told Sirius.",4
Harry could see the conclusion forming  in his uncle’s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent.,4
"It’s over, he told himself.",4
"You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy — ” But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione’s words, they had all raised  their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.",4
"“Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said.",4
"It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn’t seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight.",4
"The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight.",4
"He paused for a moment, and then a number shot out of his wand too — four.",4
The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping like stones to the floor.,4
"“Hello,” said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs. Weasley’s face.",4
"... And then, the dungeon returned.",4
The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday.,4
"Only one known person has ever survived it, and he’s sitting right in front of me.” Harry felt his face redden as Moody’s eyes (both of them) looked into his own.",4
Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again.,4
"Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s voice spoke from under the mask.",4
"They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny.",4
"Brought up by the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year.",4
"He was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus Dumbledore was crouched over him.",4
"I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did.",4
"Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks ... he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them.",4
Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.” “What are you talking about?” said Ron.,4
"...” “That’s right, Harry ... just let go now.",4
"He’d done a runner.” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, shaking his head.",4
"...” “My brother’s Crouch’s personal assistant,” Ron informed Sirius.",4
I don’t want it and I don’t need it.,4
I’m not worried at all.,4
Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.,4
He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it .,4
“I know I haven’t got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning.,4
"“Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look.",4
"“Reckon they’ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?” “Dunno,” said Harry.",4
"“Yeah,” said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall.",4
"I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely — ” “These names are?” said Mr. Crouch sharply.",4
"“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione.",4
...” Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it.,4
“It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!” Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.,4
I made the dustbins move around the yard.,4
They let go extremely quickly.,4
"“It hasn’t got a newspaper, though,” she said, looking disappointed.",4
"He must’ve left the grounds, then.”  “But under his own steam?” said Hermione eagerly, “or because someone made him?” “Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn’t they?” said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.",4
"Dumbledore told me wha’ you did, Harry.” Hagrid’s chest swelled as he looked at Harry.",4
"“Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn’t do it, it wasn’t me!” “I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch, “to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!” In unison, the witches and wizards along the right- hand side of the dungeon raised their hands.",4
"Know who he is, Dennis ?” Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs.",4
"“Evil, he is,” Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room.",4
"And anyway, you’ve already worked it out — haven’t you?” “Er ... nearly,” said Harry.",4
"Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore’s.",4
Please don’t bother me again unless it’s something important.,4
"Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose.",4
"... Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris, Hogsmeade ...  Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them.",4
"“Krum’s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,” said Charlie shortly.",4
They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me.,4
"They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another’s minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry’s chest kept squeaking their names: “Troy — Mullet — Moran).” And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.",4
"...” She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.",4
"He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.",4
The silvery substance had become transparent; it looked like glass.,4
The Ministry was  under great pressure to catch those who had done it.,4
Snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now.,4
"We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he’d made a mistake, he’d cough up.",4
"Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, “Been having a lot of trouble with him.",4
“This one’s a — a — a ten?,4
"About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature.",4
"“Well, I know your father of old, boy.",4
"“He attacked me!” Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head.",4
"“Hang on,” said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, “there’s a spare niffler here ... who’s missin’?",4
"“Listen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?” “No, of course not,” said Hermione curtly, “I hardly think students are supposed to — ” “Well, we have,” said George, indicating Fred, “loads of times, to nick food.",4
There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid.,4
"He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone  spoke to him.",4
"“Only thing we know for sure is that he’s not here.” He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth.",4
"Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly.",4
"“Take them away, and may they rot there!” “Father!",4
"Stupefy !” But it was no use — the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it.",4
"Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks — and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if  a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake’s floor.",4
"He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn’t have given them jobs, so why shouldn’t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit — ” “ — evil,” said Ron promptly.",4
Why hadn’t he just grabbed Ron and gone?,4
"Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced himself — “Can I borrow this?” “Oh!” said Harry.",4
Surely there could be nothing worse than dragons coming?,4
He is mine!” shrieked Voldemort.,4
He looked furiously around at Krum.,4
"Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons ... the only champion who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum.",4
“Don’t apologize for bothering me!,4
“But that was all your savings!” said Ron.,4
Hagrid kept glancing along the table at her.,4
"“ — and he hit Goyle — look — ” Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.",4
"... Cho’s face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration.",4
"Hermione’s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s way too much bother to do every day,” she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.",4
“The Goblet of Fire’s just gone out — it won’t reignite until the start of the next tournament — ” “ — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!” exploded Karkaroff.,4
"When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts.",4
"The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense.",4
"They knew where Harry’s bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night.",4
"... Not much for me to do!” Behind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air.",4
"you were thrown into this tournament, you didn’t volunteer for it... and if ...” (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) “if I can help at all ... a prod in the right direction ... I’ve taken a liking to you ... the way you got past that dragon!",4
"“You just said that to get rid of Neville!” “Oh did I?” said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously.",4
"Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place.",4
“Are you going to tell us — ?” Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.,4
He had never seen anything that looked less like a pig.,4
"When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, “Pine fresh,” just as Cedric had told him.",4
"So — after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry’s bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia — the new regime had begun.",4
"No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can.",4
"“That hurts — get off — ouch — ” “Harry Potter must wake up, sir!” “Stop poking me — ”  “Dobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake up!” Harry opened his eyes.",4
"They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching.",4
"“I — I is finding it ... finding it there, sir.",4
"It was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass.",4
"I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.” The Gryffindors roared with laughter.",4
"When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class.",4
"“See you, Dobby!” “Harry Potter .",4
He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.,4
“Harry Potter needs to hurry!” squeaked Dobby.,4
"... You have to get ready for your first task.” “Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter.",4
He took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak.,4
...” A cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides.,4
"“Then you’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.” “You’re eating again, I notice,” said Ron, watching Hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too.",4
"...” In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed.",4
"It seems harsh, maybe, but you’ve got to know.",4
I’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together.,4
"The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands.",4
"Then he said, “You’ve got to know.",4
"Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him.",4
"“No, I’m not,” said Harry.",4
"“That will do to be going on with,” said Dumbledore, stepping between them once more.",4
"They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes.",4
"He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full-length wizard’s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.",4
But it was the man’s eyes that made him frightening.,4
Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.” Harry snorted into his plate of goulash.,4
"Completely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took.",4
"“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.",4
"“Moody’s not here to look after you now — do it, if you’ve got the guts — ” For a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.",4
"I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster.",4
"Oh and we’ll throw in a fake wand.” “You don’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that — ” Percy hissed, but Bagman didn’t seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter.",4
"Oh, I’ll get her back for this.",4
He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again.,4
Snape was going to poison him.,4
"“Indeed, yes,” said the voice.",4
"He was an Auror — one of the best ... a Dark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank look.",4
"“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking anxious.",4
"There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be.",4
"“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.",4
"“Hi, Parvati!” Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief.",4
"“What’s that?” “Next time there’s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!” Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to bed.",4
The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.,4
... We’ve been here all night.,4
“And I don’t want them to die either!” Cho’s head was on Hermione ’s shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale.,4
"why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?” No one spoke.",4
"A thousand Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for!” “Maybe someone’s hoping Potter is going to die for it,” said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.",4
"“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort ... perhaps they now pay allegiance to another .",4
Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool.,4
“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.,4
"At the same moment, Bill, Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys’ tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.",4
"“You,” he barked at Harry.",4
"“So, of course, they were stuck.",4
"“Ow!” said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.",4
"She got up, stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for him to pass.",4
"But you 11 all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles.",4
The man behind the muscles?,4
"She looked slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick.",4
"It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.",4
"He wanted to attend the feast — well, it’s quite out of the question, you know  what he’s like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a plate of food without throwing it.",4
"... We’ll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we.",4
"“Well get it,” said Fred at once.",4
“I think he said he’d been too busy.” Sirius paced all around the cave in silence.,4
The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder.,4
"Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away.",4
“He hasn’t come back to Hogsmeade?” said Ron incredulously.,4
They all looked back as they reached the trees.,4
"“Come ON\” Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing.",4
Harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.,4
"“And now,” roared Ludo Bagman’s voice, “kindly put your wands in the air ... for the Irish National Team Mascots!” Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and- gold comet came zooming into the stadium.",4
"Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.",4
"“How d’you know where he Disapparated to?” “Come off it,” said Ron incredulously.",4
"He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened.",4
"“And we don’t have to worry about Disarming, because he’s been able to do that for ages.",4
The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed.,4
"Come now, come now .",4
"“There you go,” he said.",4
"“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on.",4
"Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn’t dare slow down.",4
"“You take this,” he muttered to her.",4
"“Winky, don’t cry, please don’t ...” But Winky cried harder than ever.",4
"Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.",4
He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday.,4
"“Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.” Parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait.",4
"“Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh?",4
"“He is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!” The left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.",4
"“Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble.",4
“It most certainly isn’t!” said the pale witch indignantly.,4
He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes.,4
“I really hope you do well.” Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid.,4
You’ve only done one task; whoever put you in for the tournament’s got plenty more opportunity if they’re trying to hurt you.,4
She was sitting next to Hagrid.,4
"“Bad headache.” “My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!” said Professor Trelawney “If you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever — ”  “I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure,” said Harry.",4
"He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes.",4
Aunt Petunia wasn’t eating anything at all.,4
...” Hermione took a jam tart.,4
"Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop.",4
"“Listen to this: ‘If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were sadly disappointed.",4
"On the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task.",4
... That one was very popular once too.,4
You need to be prepared.,4
"He knows the headmaster, you see.",4
"Percy, very pink around the ears, busied himself with the kettle.",4
"“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said Charlie.",4
"“They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,” said Harry.",4
"“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid gruffly.",4
"He wasn’t dreading anything at the moment at all ... well, unless you counted his fears that Sirius had been caught ... but what did Professor Trelawney know?",4
"I’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them more than usual before long.” “Harry,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.” “Yeah,” said Harry, grinning.",4
"Harry couldn’t take the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his  watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.",4
Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds.,4
“You can replay action .,4
"how much?” For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.",4
Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning.,4
“What happened?” he asked more urgently.,4
"The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff.",4
"... “And now — we duel.”  Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse.",4
"“Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out.",4
"Well, they would’ve been in the trees near us, wouldn’t they?",4
"She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.",4
"“Viktor, how are you feeling?",4
"Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody’s next question brought him sharply back to earth.",4
"Haven’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions?”  “No,” said Harry and Ron together.",4
Harry kept looking behind him.,4
"... I’ll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he’s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn’t he?",4
There will be no more argument.,4
"Harry was so angry that the Daily  Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.",4
"...” Moody’s normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon Harry.",4
"At this point, Harry found he could not continue.",4
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen.,4
"When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey.",4
"“That’s never — you’re kidding — ” Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes.",4
"Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius — how ’re you doing?” Sirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him.",4
"He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, but it didn’t look like that this time; if it had been, they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke.",4
“Running away when he’d expressly told her not to ... embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry .,4
"“This is o’ny me second year,” said Hagrid.",4
"“Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play.",4
"Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.",4
“What about Hermione Granger?” said Parvati.,4
"Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair.",4
"“Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.”  Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied.",4
"Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more.",4
"“Get stuffed, Malfoy,” said Harry.",4
“I must see the Diggorys.,4
Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing.,4
Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant?,4
"“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered.",4
You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now?,4
"Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric’s body lay and returned with Harry’s wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry’s hand without looking at him.",4
"... And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount.",4
You won’t be able to get through there.” “Damn!” said Mr. Weasley’s voice.,4
“I mean ... it’s still only a shape in the sky.,4
Mad-Eye Moody was sitting there — except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance.,4
"To Harry’s fury, he began to read the article aloud.",4
"They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.",4
Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears.,4
It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch.,4
"Muggle fireplaces aren’t supposed to be connected, strictly speaking — but I’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me.",4
The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight.,4
"He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double.",4
"It’s only fair, Dumbledore.” “But Karkaroff, it doesn’t work like that,” said Bagman.",4
"Hermione ’s front teeth — already larger than average — were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin — panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry.",4
The boy began to scream.,4
This Mark has  been growing clearer all year.,4
"Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!” It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all.",4
Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.” They returned to the castle for lunch.,4
"one of them would come and perform the magic I  could not, to restore me to a body .",4
Ought to have left the office early once in a while ... gotten to know his own son.” He began to wolf down large pieces of bread.,4
"I am becoming seriously concerned, I can’t deny it — ” “Then flee,” said Snape’s voice curtly.",4
"“I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy — ” Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione.",4
"He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call “normal.” Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness.",4
"You’re very lucky ... this is quite shallow ... it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though.",4
"I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?” “No,” said Harry, “I was born in July.” Ron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.",4
The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw.,4
"“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though.",4
"With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.",4
"Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation.",4
"“He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that night.”  “Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said Hagrid.",4
"From what Harry  could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime ’s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.",4
"“We only sent Hedwig yesterday.” “No, it’s not that,” said Hermione.",4
"Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.",4
"Come now, Potter, I have experience in these matters!” Harry looked up at her.",4
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment.",4
"The entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers, all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task.",4
"“I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur — ” “What does Mad-Eye say happened?” asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.",4
Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad’s ... never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who!,4
“I didn’t need to use it before we got in the forest.,4
"“You lot — get into the woods, and stick together.",4
"“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night.",4
"“I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed — ” Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal.",4
"They’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all.” Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding.",4
"How you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?” “Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely.",4
“I’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.” Snape’s eyes flashed.,4
"By the evening before the second task, Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare.",4
"All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.",4
Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.,4
‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school.,4
He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.,4
“I told you!” Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article.,4
He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now — but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.,4
Harry pulled out his wand.,4
There was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably worse.,4
Let me remind you how the points currently stand!,4
Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.,4
"And don’t forget, if you’re talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?” He handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak good-bye.",4
One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.” There was a silence.,4
"“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman excitedly.",4
Harry’s hands and feet were freezing.,4
He’s returned?” “And the Death Eaters came ... and then we dueled.,4
"“A little break,” said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, “a little pause .",4
Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game.,4
"“So ... going to enter, Weasley?",4
"“I don’t like people who attack when their opponent’s back’s turned,” growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain.",4
He doubted very much whether a book could help him now.,4
I wanted Harry Potter’s blood.,4
"And since he got out, from what I  can tell, he’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his.",4
He was carrying his crossbow.,4
"“Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster.",4
"Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry’s shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started.",4
"... “Three ...” muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, “two ... one ...”  It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward.",4
"Harry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast.",4
"The pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn’t there.",4
And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway.,4
"It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potter’s brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You- Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deep-seated confusion.",4
"Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, “ Sonorus,” and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands.",4
"... “Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped.",4
“Professor Moody?” Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd.,4
"“Just let go, Mr. Crouch, and I’ll get him.",4
"“This is Amos Diggory, everyone,” said Mr. Weasley.",4
"The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him.",4
"zey are like ’uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place.",4
"They were free to seek him, but they did not.",4
"Cedric looked as though he didn’t want to say whatever it was in front of Ron, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.",4
"The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence.",4
Hasn’t got two Galleons to rub together.,4
He felt the heat rise in his face and neck.,4
"“Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?” “What is it with her?” said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase.",4
"“You were supposed to say Harry’s a mad delinquent!” “But he’s not!” said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.",4
"Then he came back within Harry’s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave.",4
"“Undiluted bubotuber pus!” said Ron, picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it.",4
"Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort’s feet.",4
Now the burning feeling was in his throat too.,4
"Behind their headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too.",4
Winky would appear to be alone.,4
"However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away.",4
"“He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!” “He knew they were never going to catch up!” Harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding  loudly.",4
"Mum an’ Dad gone, an’ you was feelin’ like yeh wouldn’ fit in at Hogwarts, remember?",4
"For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing.",4
"They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.",4
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument.",4
"“But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.” A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone  steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid ’s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.",4
"I is just picking it up, sir!",4
"Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches.",4
"A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder.",4
“You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.” He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window.,4
"He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry’s hand, and then Ron’s.",4
Flesh given by a servant.,4
"They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable.",4
Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back down for Hermione and the others?,4
Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought.,4
Harry stared at the dot.,4
"Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.",4
"“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire.",4
"You know that, don’t you?” “Yes, Master,” moaned Wormtail, “please, Master ... please ...”  “Yet you helped return me to my body,” said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground.",4
"“So tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?” “You know your mother, Malfoy?” said Harry — both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy — “that expression she’s got, like she’s got dung under her nose?",4
"...” “I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from behind Fred and George.",4
The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ” “Preposterous!” shouted Fudge again.,4
"“Good service!” Ron said, in an impressed voice.",4
"“Get up, I’ll take you to Dumbledore!” Mr. Crouch’s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.",4
"“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him.",4
Harry — you come here an’ help me with this big one.,4
It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence.,4
"“Get back to bed, Snape.” “You don’t have the authority to send me anywhere!” Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself.",4
“Great long price lists for stuff they’ve invented.,4
I’ll come back to that .,4
"There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn’t blow his whistle.",4
Let him smell fresh air for once.,4
"...” “Why should ’e complain?” burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot.",4
"... Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink.",4
"As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.",4
"“When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did Crouch do?” “Went to look in the bushes,” said Harry, “but there wasn’t anyone else there.” “Of course,” Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, “of course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf .",4
"He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session.",4
"Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare.",4
"Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.",4
Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm.,4
"I suppose you’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions — ” “I’d never help him work out that egg!” said Hermione, looking outraged.",4
He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes.,4
"“Don’t lie to me,” Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harry’s.",4
"They knew that old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.",4
"Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.",4
Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.,4
"And how she found out about Hagrid’s mum!” “Maybe she had you bugged,” said Harry.",4
"A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize.",4
Lots of people were watching.,4
"“What if they can’t get them down?” “They will,” said Ron reassuringly.",4
"But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, “All right, all right, if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman.”  “Bagman?” said Harry sharply.",4
"“They’ll find a way.” “Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic’s out here tonight!” said Hermione.",4
"For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation.",4
"Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor.",4
“I wish to be of use to the Ministry.,4
"Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her  normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other.",4
"“Of course he isn’t!” said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited.",4
"It wasn’t as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn’t have any lace on them at all — in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.",4
"Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.",4
"... You’d better get out of the way, we’ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five- fifteen.",4
"“Map of Hogwarts,” said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.",4
“Please continue.” “Voldemort got a letter from an owl.,4
"“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand.",4
"“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please ...” said Professor McGonagall.",4
I know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you’re around Dumbledore and Moody I don’t think anyone will be able to hurt you.,4
"Most of the class — Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead — had fled into Hagrid ’s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid.",4
"“What’s up?” “Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid.",4
"The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire.",4
"In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.",4
"Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry’s mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away.",4
"In a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know- Who’s fall from power — thereby driving Hagrid ’s own mother, like the rest of You-Know- Who’s  supporters, into hiding.",4
Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.,4
“ — just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year.,4
"“I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards’ Conference?” “Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling.",4
“Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we don’t.,4
Harry had the impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.,4
...” “No — it was just — you dropped your quill.” It was Cho.,4
"Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.",4
"Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.",4
They lose the will to live.,4
The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday.,4
She slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.,4
"His face was still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching.",4
"Nervous?” “I haven’t really thought ... yeah, nervous, I suppose,” said Harry.",4
"“Hello, Professor McGonagall,” said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher.",4
"“So ... tell me ...” said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire.",4
"Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop.",4
"He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.",4
"“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw  herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.",4
“Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him.,4
"Just thought I’d offer ...” “Well, thanks,” said Harry, “but I think I’m nearly there with the egg .",4
"Before the train had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.",4
"“Look!” said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window.",4
"At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs.",4
"He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now.",4
They want to beat Dumbledore.,4
Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott were swapping  Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory\ badges on their cloaks.,4
"Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry.",4
Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix.,4
"The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks.",4
"Harry’s nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks.",4
"Still, there was nothing in sight.",4
"As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.",4
"“ ’Lo, Fawkes,” said Harry quietly.",4
Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.,4
They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him.,4
"Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them.",4
The fire in the goblet had just turned red again.,4
He climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row.,4
And I can give him my cauldron report in person.” He bustled out of the kitchen.,4
"“Did anyone know except your father and the house-elf?” “Yes,” said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again.",4
"This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark.",4
"“Because he’s being stupid,” said Ginny.",4
Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast.,4
It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.,4
“My master sent me word of my father’s escape.,4
"“Very well ... if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go back up to the castle, shall we, it’s a bit chilly.",4
"Angelina!”  Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.",4
There were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear.,4
"“You’re going to make yourself puke instead?” “No,” said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts.",4
"Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.",4
"“Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven’t got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum — ” But Ron ignored Harry too.",4
"Or speak to the offender’s Head of House!” “I’ll do that, then,” said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.",4
"If he’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat Buckbeak.” “D’you know Crouch, then?” said Harry.",4
"Dimly, he could tell that something was wrong.",4
"Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer.",4
"“I don’t know,” said Ron.",4
"“Nasty little shock for old Barty, I’d imagine.",4
“How is he?” said Harry.,4
Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.,4
"Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee were black.",4
"“There you go,” Harry said.",4
"On Snape ’s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall’s.",4
His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom.,4
The moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.,4
and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years.,4
Keep your eyes open — particularly when the person we discussed is around — and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.,4
Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us?,4
She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all.,4
The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away .,4
"Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating.",4
Moody put up a struggle.,4
...  And then the solution came to him.,4
"“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if you’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your class — ” “I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” Harry said quickly, looking at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.",4
"“What’s Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?” he asked.",4
"He was dreading the Leaving Feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House Championship would be announced.",4
I believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as the Apparition point.,4
The man with the cold voice had killed a woman.,4
"Then he said, “Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you’d left the Top Box?” “Erm ...” Harry thought hard.",4
"But don’t touch my hand, now.",4
"I won’t do it, I won’t say it.",4
Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night.,4
Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.,4
“What was it like?” said Harry eagerly.,4
"“I assure you, he is  extremely well trained.",4
“Master ... Master ...” he murmured.,4
Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.,4
"“Curious,” he had said, “curious,” and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry’s wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort’s.",4
How on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg?,4
"“Loo/d” He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar.",4
Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction.,4
Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort.,4
"“You don’t mind, do you, Harry?” Parvati said.",4
“Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night?,4
"“I’m aware of that, Potter,” she said.",4
"Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass.",4
Moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.,4
"Not clothes, not clothes!” Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments.",4
"When none appeared, he tried the Reductor Curse again.",4
"Harry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up.",4
"The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone’s eye (he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed  one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.",4
"You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation  and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.” “Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.",4
"“There’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked for Voldemort.” “Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape ’s office then?” said Ron stubbornly.",4
"The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill.",4
"“I didn’t, I swear it, Father, don’t send me back to the dementors — ” “You are further accused,” bellowed Mr. Crouch, “of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom’s wife, when he would not give you information.",4
"The  nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.",4
"“Got to give our champions their instructions, haven’t we?",4
Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby — he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet — and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime.,4
And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!” “But what were Voldemort’s supporters — ” Harry began.,4
Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock.,4
"I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited.",4
...” And the dungeon dissolved again.,4
She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department.,4
"“There’s something funny, though,” said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles.",4
A cloudless night coming .,4
"Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end.",4
I bin stupid ... my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o’ the way I’ve bin behavin’.,4
"“You admit that he has been having these pains, then?” said Fudge quickly.",4
"I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?” “No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry.",4
I expected him to punish  them.,4
He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned .,4
"“Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry.",4
"“Oh really!” she sputtered, going rather red.",4
"“Wands out, d’you reckon?” “Yeah,” said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.",4
"CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he roared, and the whole class jumped again.",4
Crouch will need all hands on deck.,4
The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole.,4
Ron dived into his bag for his schedule.,4
"“If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first “Don’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote!” said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.",4
“You know I didn’t.”  Both of them stared just as blankly back.,4
"“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later.",4
"“And now,” he said, “it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are.",4
"He whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick, pearly glasses.",4
"He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table.",4
And she’s got some gold out of your vault for you ... and she’s washed all your socks.” He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry’s camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it.,4
"Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons’ enclosure — though of course, they didn’t yet know what they would find there.",4
"The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov —  The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough.",4
"It was now slicked down into two bunches — perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill’s, but found he had too much hair.",4
"“There you go,” said Fred to Harry and Ron, “piece of cake.” He got to his feet, yawning, and said, “We’d better use a school owl then, George, come on.",4
“Ivanova!” A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.,4
"...” Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree.",4
"He couldn’t hear Crouch’s voice anymore, but he knew where he was going; it hadn’t been much past the Beauxbatons carriage ... somewhere around here.",4
"She looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron’s arm sympathetically.",4
"Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are  often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.” Similarly, “anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.” Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.",4
"“There’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,” Dean told Harry.",4
“And my elf has been stunned.” “Stunned?,4
"Then she said, “Did you get all this from the kitchens, Fred?”  “Yep,” said Fred, grinning at her.",4
However ... Mr. Potter’s score is forty-five points.” Harry’s stomach leapt — he was now tying for first place with Cedric.,4
for — with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information.,4
"“C’mon, then — I’ll go first — ” Harry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley — Hog warts.",4
"Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.",4
"... “Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction.",4
"I said to him, I said — Ced, that’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.",4
All of them looked cheerful and relaxed.,4
"Moody turned to look at Harry — at least, his normal eye was looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.",4
It was all becoming confused.,4
"Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody’s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting.",4

"“Hagrid, it’s us!” Harry shouted, pounding on the door.",4
"Prefer brooms — slower, but safer.” “But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?” “Charlie had to take the test twice,” said Fred, grinning.",4
"“And that’s Minerva McGonagall’s, isn’t it?",4
He was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole.,4
"“Damn them!” he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop\ “Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?” said Hermione, frowning.",4
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.",4
"Malfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words “my father” were distinguishable.",4
"Hermione’s hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.",4
"George, however, leaned in toward Hermione.",4
"It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear.",4

They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs — but still without recognizable heads or eyes.,4

"To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Tri- wizard Cup and Cedric’s body.",4
“He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him.,4
All the curtains were closed.,4
"Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master.",4
"Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn’t he?",4
But then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head.,4
"About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch?” “Yeah,” said Harry and Ron slowly.",4
“And the Fat Lady?” said Bill.,4
"He wasn’t following Dudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it.",4
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered.,4
"When the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry.",4
"Now, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry — ” “ — you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.",4
"“Ah yes, I can see the plugs.",4
"He pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him.",4
"“You’ll be up in the Top Box with me — I’m commentating!” He waved, Barty Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them Disapparated.",4
It wasn’t the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury.,4
"Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione loaded their own plates.",4
"“I mean, I know he’s a genius and everything ...” “Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.",4

"“Ali thinks there’s a niche in the market for a family vehicle,” said Mr. Crouch.",4
“Why don’t you come up to my office?,4
"What did you see?” “Nothing,” Harry lied.",4
"He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him.",4
"“Made friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?” Percy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous.",4
"A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else’s.",4
"Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but — well, as I say, he’s getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he’s found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left.",4
"More likely there’s a very shell- shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings.",4
"He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice.",4
“My God — Diggory!” it whispered.,4

"“You seem to be drowning twice,” said Hermione.",4

It’s still a Hogwarts victory.,4
"Okay, I’ll lose a bet.” “Yeah, you’ll be betting I’ll win my fight.",4
"For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.",4
"“We can leave that till morning, can’t we, Dumbledore?” said Sirius harshly.",4
"Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year — they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it.",4
"Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second.",4
"The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract.",4
"He mentioned his son.” “Well, that was his fault,” said Hermione testily.",4

“The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars.,4
"“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys.",4
"“Well ...” said Ron slowly, “I dunno if they would.",4
Harry glanced up at the ceiling too.,4
"Harry took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.",4
"“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all.",4
“I can’t believe this ...,4
It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark.,4
“You all righ’?” he said gruffly.,4
"Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been leading up to, and would finish with, the first task.",4
If he’d just had the sense to keep it to himself.,4
"A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year.",4
"... You treat it regularly?” “Polished it last night,” said Cedric, grinning.",4
"“Someone’s coming,” he said suddenly.",4
"Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren’t; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.",4
Your elf was saving you a seat too — gulping gargoyles!” Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet.,4
"Her giant eyes flickered from Mr. Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch.",4
"“Who ’re you going with?” he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.",4
But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry’s name got into the Goblet of Fire?,4
"Wear that cloak.” Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see yeh, Hermione,” winked, and departed.",4
"“There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy.",4
"Maybe your father’s too junior to know about it, Weasley ... yes ... they probably don’t talk about important stuff in front of him.",4
"He didn’t like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some.",4
"“Sometimes, when a person’s memory’s modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while .",4
“Don’t be so stupid!” she said after a moment.,4
"He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance.",4
"He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.",4
"“Who’s that?” he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces.",4
"“He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.” “Does he, now?” said Sirius, frowning more deeply.",4
"“Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,” Mrs. Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain- washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars.",4
“I’ve got her number now!,4
"The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink.",4
Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.,4
"“All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder — ” “IP” whispered the second voice.",4
"“ — and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her, so I had to come back here and live in my toilet.” “Good,” said Harry vaguely.",4
"“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?” Harry said, very surprised.",4
"Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this.",4
"Up here, if you please!” “Go on,” Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.",4
"“I’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can’t transform.",4
"Your mother — ” “Don’t be a spoilsport, Arthur!” boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly.",4
"When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again.",4
"... You’ve dropped something, by the way.",4
"Ron and Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.",4
"Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas was over — everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.",4
Peeves was not the only thing that was moving.,4
"Harry, if you leave your school list out, I’ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley.",4
Don’t forget what I said about your scar.,4
The ones who escaped Azkaban?” “What?” said Harry.,4
"“About a  quarter of a mile’s walk over there, first field you come to.",4
"He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder.",4
"As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays.",4
"“They’ve got ... they’ve got Ron?” “The thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!” squeaked Dobby.",4
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s gang of Slytherin girls.",4
"The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues.",4
"His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat’s, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness.",4
"“Come on, jump!” “I can’t,” Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and struggling not to sink.",4
how you have achieved this .,4
"“Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter ‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir!",4
"Moody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it.",4
"“Er ... who could that be?” “Slow, aren’t you?” He had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat.",4
"For a moment, Harry didn’t recognize him ... then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.",4
"There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.",4
"“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before.",4
"“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin.",4
"“ Tis part of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir.",4
We journeyed to his house.,4
"He had two choices — try and move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued and disqualified from the task.",4
I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed.,4
"There are things I need to warn you about.” “What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches.",4
"“I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,” said Karkaroff.",4
“D’you want to be showing off your knickers in midair?,4
"What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room.",4
"“My mistake,” Moody said calmly.",4
"“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn’t seem to understand a word of English.",4
“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting.,4
“We’ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes!,4
I could not possess her.,4
"“And so am I, Snape ... very interested.",4
I could not touch the boy.” Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry’s cheek.,4
"“Complaining about security at the World Cup,” said Percy.",4
Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!” “Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly.,4
I had the map with me.,4
... “But how to get at Harry Potter?,4
"Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, “Renneruate.” Krum opened his eyes.",4
"“Bring as many of these books as you can, okay?” “Right,” said Harry uneasily.",4
“He looks a terrible mess.,4
He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor.,4
That’s what you’re up against.,4
We’re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports.,4
"I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.” Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn.",4
"Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter “ Slave labor,” before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls’ dormitory.",4
"This was a bad joke, it had to be.",4
"“Yeah ... we’ve helped each other out, haven’t we?",4
I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance.,4
"Moody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.",4
"Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.",4
"“Yes, it’s a minute off.",4
"He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.",4
... It’s not like Crouch.,4
"“What did you want to attack us for?” “Do not lie, sir!” shouted Mr. Crouch.",4
"“You haven’t been mixing up Love Potions, have you?” “Don’t be stupid,” Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again.",4
"“Let’s see ... a Galleon on Ireland to win?” “A Galleon?” Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself.",4
Been humming ever since I got here.,4
"“Right.” “Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.",4
“I wish England had got through.,4
"It was Amos Diggory, Cedric’s father.",4
They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them.,4
"He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and looked around.",4
"Mine!” Snape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face — “Accio Parchments The map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape ’s outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moody’s hand.",4
"The door was barred, and Harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time.",4
"He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat.",4
"are going ... to kill me too?” “Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why would I kill you?",4
"He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort’s wand was something it couldn’t help — rather as he couldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia.",4
"A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak.",4
"A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all.",4
"...”  Filch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust- colored cat at his heels.",4
"And you picked it up and thought you’d have some fun with it, did you?” “I is not doing magic with it, sir!” squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose.",4
Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken.,4
"“Yes, and that doesn’t make sense at all,” said Sirius.",4
"“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said Charlie.",4
"“You’ve just had breakfast!” said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.",4
Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.,4
"I mean to say ...” “Come off it, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “you don’t seriously think it was the elf?",4
The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him.,4
"“What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for?” “They’ve got an electric fire,” Harry explained.",4
"The direction of the beam’s movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily.",4
He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts.,4
"We’d never have found out about all these hexes in class.” “Good training for when we’re all Aurors,” said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair.",4
"When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.” “And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said Dumbledore.",4
"Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him.",4
"Harry couldn’t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something.",4
She hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last.,4
"and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead.",4
"“The Snitch, where’s the Snitch?” bellowed Charlie, along the row.",4
"They didn’t have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass.",4
“All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn’t want to kiss?” Harry asked.,4
"I’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I’m not the only one who’s getting worried.” He nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them.",4
"From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know- Who’s instructions!” “Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,” Dumbledore said.",4
"Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because “I didn’t enter,” said Harry, starting to feel irritated.",4
"“You’re not ... his?” whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.",4
"The usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight.",4
Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.,4
"The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked.",4
“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said Dumbledore brightly into the silence.,4
"“Let us hear them, please.” “You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly, “that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy.",4
... Harry had never seen a dementor stumble.,4
"“But I ... but ...”  An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione ’s face.",4
Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire.,4
"Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out: Dear Harry, Congratulations on getting past the Horntail.",4
He was going to make Harry relive everything.,4
"I wouldn’t mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp bed.” Hermione snorted.",4
"Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.",4
"Oh the shame, the shame!” She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.",4
"Then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.",4
"Weasley, it’s Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up.",4
The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again.,4
"“Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it?",4
"Out in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder’s Map to check that the coast was still clear.",4
"Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy — ” “Find my what?”  “ — and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!” “What’s a Wheezy?” “Your Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy — Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!” Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts.",4
He  examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely.,4
"Harry didn’t understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign.",4
"helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way.",4
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry’s mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.",4
"“You’re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!” “No, no, I’m not!” she said hastily.",4
"“I’d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,” said Professor Karkaroff.",4
"Parvati and Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum.",4
"“Oh yeah ...” “I don’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,” said Sirius, still pacing.",4
“I’ve got to go and look for people who can’t use their voices above the ground.,4
"When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again, though, as Ron said, “Like we’d say anything else surrounded by that lot.”  “I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?” said Hermione.",4
“D’you — d’you want to go to the ball with me?” said Harry.,4
"They knocked, and Fang’s booming barks answered.",4
"What’re you going to do in Binns’s class — read again?” Exempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third task.",4
"Harry, still staring at the place where Moody’s face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass.",4
"Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.",4
"Half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads, and laughing.",4
"Each was squirming slightly  and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.",4
"A screech owl arrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual.",4
"Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.",4
Hermione was very surprised that Harry was going to go.,4
"He’d be trying to do you in again, wouldn’t he?",4
"“What’s he like?” “He’s okay,” said Harry.",4
"“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!” The surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked.",4
“She was one o’ the las’ ones in Britain.,4
"“You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,” said Voldemort.",4
"“I’m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.” “No, you’re not!” yelled his friend.",4
"Now, yeh’ll wan’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things — I’ve never had ’em before, not sure what they’ll go fer — I got ant eggs an’ frog livers an’ a bit o’ grass snake — just try ’em out with a bit of each.” “First pus and now this,” muttered Seamus.",4
"“I s’pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library?” “Yes, he did,” said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly.",4
"and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.",4
He was looking around the graveyard.,4
"But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done ... on the hour .",4
"“Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don’t go picking them up and playing with them .",4
"And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.",4
"The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else.",4
"Hagrid ’s fingers.” At that moment, a voice said, “Excuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?” It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore’s speech.",4
Harry’s hands were numb with clapping.,4
"It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind — but  worse, a hundred times worse.",4
One of the marchers below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.,4
"“Everyone,” Mr. Weasley continued, “this is Ludo Bagman, you know who he is, it’s thanks to him we’ve got such good tickets — ” Bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.",4
“You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?” Harry asked.,4
Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned.,4
"“You haven’t been to see me for ages.” “Yeah ... well ...” said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn’t  see anything but his head, “I’m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I?",4
"After about fifty yards, they reached a fork.",4
"“ ’Course, we found out what was going on in the end.",4
"“So go on — how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts?” “It’s bewitched,” said Hermione.",4
"Hermione, budge up, make a space — ” “What?” “Too late,” said Ron bitterly.",4
"You will collect the pus — ” “The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.",4
"Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.",4
"Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.",4
"Each of them pressed their badges too, until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry.",4
"In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding  creatures he has dubbed “Blast-Ended Skrewts, ” highly dangerous crosses between manticores and fire- crabs.",4
"That’s not the point of a house- elf,’ they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby ’s face!",4
“Our examination of the grounds will not take long.” They trooped out in silence past him and closed the door.,4
"“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry, squinting up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime — raise her wand in the air.",4
"The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.",4
"All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.",4
"Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?”  “Roun’ the middle,” said Hagrid, demonstrating.",4
"Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.",4
"“Here, look.” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley.",4
“Elf!” said Mr. Diggory sternly.,4
"I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear.” Harry stared at Moody.",4
"“Some of these are bound to come in handy.” “Come and look at this,” said Ron, who was standing by the window.",4
“How dare he accuse Dumbledore.,4
"... Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” ... “He’s taking risks, this one!” ... “Clever move — pity it didn’t work!” And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg.",4
“He said he’s getting stronger.” There was a pause.,4
"their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction — and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.” At this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.",4
"I see difficult times ahead for you, alas ... most difficult ...",4
the one who had caught so many Death Eaters .,4
"Hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring after her.",4
"Let’s just take it together.” For a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn’t believe his ears; then his face split in a grin.",4
"Then Professor McGonagall’s voice called, “Champions over here, please!” Parvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said “See you in a minute” to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through.",4
"Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted.",4
"“Molly wouldn’t like — ” “Well bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,” said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all  their money, “that Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch.",4
Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something.,4
"Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen.",4
They’ll have told their champions everything they can.,4
Ah ... of course ... Rita Skeeter.” “That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!” said Percy furiously.,4
Ron obviously felt the same.,4
"Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself .",4
The pictures in this book were all moving.,4
He was looking angrier than Harry had ever seen him.,4
"She reported his trial, she knew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters.",4
"Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg.",4
"“Yeah,” said Harry, “because we’re friends.” He couldn’t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player.",4
"And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground.",4
"“Well, of course you haven’t,” said Hermione briskly, “I’ve only just started it.” “Yeah?” said Ron in mild surprise.",4
"“Just take the cup!”  “No,” said Cedric.",4
"He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him — only to find that Ron’s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.",4
"What’s he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?” Sirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall.",4
"Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.",4
“There was someone behind the trees .,4
"That’s when I open my trunk.” He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window.",4
"Drafty though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies.",4
"“We can talk later, Karkaroff!” spat Snape.",4
"My God, my father told me about it ages ago ... heard it from Cornelius Fudge.",4
"In you come, Harry, in you come ... nothing to worry about, it’s just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment — ” “Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously.",4
"Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.",4
"Everything going all right?” “Fine, thanks,” said Harry.",4
It was twenty past nine.,4
“C’mon!” But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he knew it was no good.,4
"The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty- seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch ’s office, if anybody would like to check it.” The corners of Dumbledore ’s mouth twitched.",4
"“Fine — we won’t ask you what you’re doing, if you don’t ask us,” he said.",4
"... “Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head Charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to retrieve her hostage.",4
"“The champion for Durmstrang,” he read, in a strong, clear voice, “will be Viktor Krum.” “No surprises there!” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall.",4
"It’s like Hagrid said, it’s in their natures, they’re like trolls ... they just like killing, everyone knows that.",4
"“The champions aren’t supposed to  know what’s coming — she’s bound to tell her student, isn’t she?” “Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ’em,” shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.",4
"Next, tell me what’s always the last thing to mend, The middle of middle and end of the end?",4
"“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,” said Professor McGonagall to the champions.",4
"“You just want to think Snape’s up to something,” said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box.",4
"Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams.",4
He even threw the egg across the room — though he hadn’t really expected that to help.,4
Mrs. Weasley looked most upset.,4
There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do.,4
"Yes ... yes, of course ...” Moody took hold of Harry’s arms and pulled; Harry’s leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it.",4
"It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face.",4
"There yeh go, look.” One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson’s watch off her wrist.",4
"Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!” He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.",4
"Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts.",4
"Hermione’s, however, was smaller than a chicken egg.",4
"He wasn’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry’s tip-off about the dragons.",4
"“Somewhere very cold, because they’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms.” “Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily.",4
“What about him?” said Parvati in a hard voice.,4
"There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour’s sister.",4
"“Think it’s funny, do you?” he growled.",4
"Admittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment.",4
"“You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know,” said Nearly Headless Nick.",4
"“We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch.” “If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve been easy,” said Harry.",4
One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown.,4
“They can travel by fire — only you’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on — ” He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.,4
"the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done ... and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric’s, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick.",4
"After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.",4
"A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.",4
"“And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. — well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can’t understand a word I’m saying anyway, so never mind.",4
"“Oh I am glad I’m not on duty,” muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily.",4
"“If it’s got anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes — ” “Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said Hermione from the doorway.",4
"Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed.",4
A few more months will make no difference.,4
“Harry Potter — and myself!,4
"On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff.",4
"“You’re tied in first place, Harry!",4
Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject.,4
See you later.” He and Fred left the Owlery.,4
He could see her any old time he wanted ... she wasn’t exactly hard to miss.,4
"“Thanks!” said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward.",4
"Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.” Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.",4
That’s why he rang the doorbell.,4
“I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.” When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too.,4
Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.,4
"“I would’ve gone down in the first task if you hadn’t told me what was coming.” “I had help on that too,” Harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes.",4
"The moment the note was secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the window and out of sight.",4
"“I’m not telling you, it’s her business,” said Ginny.",4
"Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, “Oh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.”  “Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered.",4
"Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.",4
"Even though he wasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence: An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes  “Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly.",4
"“Any second,” Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.",4
"“Just forget the egg for a minute, all right?” Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly  past them, landing on top of a large cabinet.",4
"“It’s been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn’t, he might start thinking something’s wrong.” He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words.",4
"Yeh’d be makin’ ’em unhappy ter take away their work, an’ insultin’ ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em.” “But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!” said Hermione.",4
“It’s in the tournament rules.,4
"Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.",4
"“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.",4
"“I could’ve taken those mer- idiots any time I wanted.” “What were you going to do, snore at them?” said Hermione waspishly.",4
She wasn’t wearing a Cedric badge though.,4
“Let her try!” said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage.,4
"“So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?” “Er — yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.",4
"Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid’s cabin would catch fire.",4
Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise.,4
"Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.",4
"Who’s there?” Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and lay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit.",4
Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around — there were no waiters.,4
"Be on the watch, Harry.",4
Fred and George had just emerged from behind some bookshelves.,4
Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.,4
"— but for once, Hermione didn’t seem to be thinking about S.P.E.W.",4
"“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate.",4
...” Bagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze.,4
Oh — talk of the devil!,4
He was shaking his head.,4
"Hang on, I’ll find your campsite.",4
"“Bet you’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric’s caught you up on points, are you?” “What?” said Harry.",4
A whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer-version of a village square.,4
He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck.,4
"“Why?” Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.",4
"“Don’t let him get you, Harry — don’t let go!” She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it ... and Voldemort’s dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn’t hear to Voldemort.",4
"When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats.",4
"“Took you long enough.” Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other.",4
Just don’t get him onto the subject of his boss.,4
"“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon.",4
"“Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?” said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation.",4
"After a minute or so, Harry heard the clunks of Moody’s wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below.",4
"“And — yes, it’s a penalty to Ireland!” The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words “HA, HA, HA!” The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again.",4
"“Shall we go down then, Harry?” “Okay,” said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room.",4
"and Dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described it to him.",4
"He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote, Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak — Harry “Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes.",4
"“Never mind, my sweet ... we’ll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to.",4
Potter ran to get Dumbledore.,4
“There just has to be!” She seemed to be taking the library’s lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before.,4
"Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it.",4
...” “You know — you know the trial you found me in?,4
"But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality.",4
Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.,4
"Don’t use Hedwig, keep changing owls, and don’t worry about me, just watch out for yourself.",4
"“Why is everything I own rubbish?” said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon’s beak.",4
All the curtains were closed.,4
"She was white to the lips, but she looked resolute.",4
"“Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,” said a voice.",4
“Professor Moody?” he said again.,4
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius.,4
“What are they doing here?” said Harry in surprise.,4
"All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer — for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.",4
“Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen’.,4
But to get him killed?,4
She had almost let me escape.” Winky let out a wail of despair.,4
The common room emptied slowly around Harry.,4
He knows who you hang around with.,4
“I owe you one for telling me about the dragons.,4
"Moody’s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled — the first time Harry had seen him do so.",4
...” He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort’s robes.,4
"Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster.",4
"Blimey, I’ll be glad when this is over.",4
"Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys’ kitchen fire.",4
"perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, “Wormtail?",4
She merely smiled her mysterious smile.,4
"The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn’t seem to have realized what had happened.",4
"Yet somehow — maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid — this woman (now at the foot of the steps,  and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large.",4
"“Let’s see now ...” She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were doing.",4
"Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it — “Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats.",4
It seemed to be stirring fretfully.,4
"No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by.",4
"... I’m guessing they submitted Potter’s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category.",4
"And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody’s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk .",4
"You don’t — touch — Daddy’s — wand — yecchh!” She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst.",4
"Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed.",4
"“Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though.",4
Sparks were flying out of it.,4
Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to.,4
"A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament.",4
"Go, Harry pleaded with him silently, go with Snape ... go ... Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch ’s legs.",4
"Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, “You’re well outside the time limit, though, Harry.",4
Krum was still staring at the ground.,4
"“What has happened?” said Dumbledore sharply, looking from Fudge to Professor McGonagall.",4
"“But we don’t know where Sirius is ... he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn’t he?” said Hermione reasonably.",4
...” Harry stared at him.,4
"Owing to the demanding and time- consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests.” Mr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.",4
"He’d have been really looking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was .",4
"“Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks!",4
"He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins ... his father ... his mother ...",4
"She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back.",4
"“Well, I’m glad someone from Gryffindor’s entering,” said Hermione.",4
“Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ” “We don’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!” said Dean Thomas indignantly.,4
"“Apologize!” Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid’s massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.",4
Percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched.,4
"“No spell can reawaken the dead,” said Dumbledore heavily.",4
"“I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,” said Hermione in a rush.",4
Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys’ stupid rules.,4
"“Of course, they would have needed to keep him alive.",4
"I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over.” “Oh Bagman’s likable enough, of course,” said Percy dismissively, “but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch!",4
"Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione without looking at her.",4
Be at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o’clock on Saturday afternoon.,4
Harry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone.,4
The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor.,4
“I thought I was paying you back.,4
"“Yeh know wha’, Harry?” he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, “when I firs’ met you, you reminded me o’ me a bit.",4
"They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked.",4
"Over at the Slytherin table, Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle.",4
Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared?” Harry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.,4
"“No idea,” said Sirius, still stuffing down bread.",4
"“That’s right,” said Sirius, and he didn’t look remotely amused now.",4
"“Nearly six,” said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates.",4
"Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail?",4
"I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.” They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric Diggory.” Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd.",4
"“Yeah, okay.”  “Good boy,” growled Moody.",4
"Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until  at last he had found the one that suited him — this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix.",4
"“On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.” Ron’s and Hermione’s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive.",4
"“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology — ” “Never mind that, Potter.",4
"For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other’s eyes.",4
"‘He still cries about his parents\ Oh bless him, I never knew\ ’ ” Harry had had enough.",4
"Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely.",4
"Don’t send me there, don’t let him!” The dementors were gliding back into the room.",4
It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy  across the ground.,4
"“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to them and said he didn’t mind practicing on his own for a while, “at least we’ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts.",4
"“Thank you for the tea, Weatherby.” He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.",4
But  he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric.,4
... Muggles do it all the time.,4
"“Now, just a quick few words.",4
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself?,4
Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.,4
"His desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he’d just seen Krum do.",4
"“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water.",4
The crowd was cheering harder than ever.,4
"“I will not,” said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra- large toy out of his sack.",4
"“Harry, I’d better hurry, I’m going to be late for Binns.",4
...” Karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students.,4
The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it.,4
"“It is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment.",4
He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said.,4
"Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort — learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry.",4
"He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, “No time, Harry — just grab a jacket and get outside — quickly!” Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.",4
"“Winky keeps — hie — her master’s secrets,” she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed.",4
"“It was you who found him, was it not?” “Yes,” said Harry.",4
"“George’s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.” “Told you, I was joking,” said George.",4
"But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.",4
Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last.,4
"“That wasn’t funny, Fred!” he shouted.",4
"“He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore.”  “No!” shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him to the chair.",4
"The Triwizard judge?” “Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid.",4
"For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared.",4
He put it back into the jar.,4
"Instantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel.",4
"“The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven’t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all.",4
"By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain  over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere.",4
Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.,4
"Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first task?",4
"A boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps.",4
"I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her ...oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed?",4
"“I don’t know where we went wrong with them,” said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans.",4
"He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.",4
"“Ar, he’s righ’, o’ course — yeh’re all righ’ ...",4
"“In here, Harry ... in here, and sit down.",4
"certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon  You-Know- Who’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore ...” “When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore steadily.",4
"“Come with me, Potter,” he growled.",4
"“Come here, I need you to take my answer back!” The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig’s cage.",4
"Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn’t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.",4
Neither of them really knew what to say.,4
"What are you talking about ... ?” “I told you, Harry ...",4
Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang.,4
"It was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done.",4
"“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?” “You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid’s words.",4
Hermione ’s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.,4
"Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving  ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed.",4
"Sirius Harry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.",4
"But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side ... well, you wouldn’t understand ... you’re too young.",4
“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again.,4
“So — straight into it.,4
"To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley’s letter again.",4
Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were.,4
"There was a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, “Well, I think I’ll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody’s got any objections.",4
I know they’d be very proud of me if they could see me now.,4
"and there would be no Peeves ... but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder’s Map ... and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show “Harry Potter” standing exactly where he was.",4
His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn’t going and sent him a cursed hat.,4
"Then Dumbledore said, “And tonight “I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,” whispered Barty Crouch.",4
"Olive Hornby came into the bathroom — ‘Are you in here again, sulking, Myrtle?’ she said, ‘because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you — ’ And then she saw my body .",4
He was not watchful enough.,4
"For those who don’t want to Apparate, or can’t, we use Portkeys.",4
"The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them.",4
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train.",4
"“How are you?” “Fine,” Harry lied.",4
"Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.",4
"She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them — but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.",4
"And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort’s mark had appeared in the sky.",4
"“Never had a lesson like it,” said Fred.",4
“We weren’t trying to hear him!” said Ron indignantly.,4
"“Good one,” said Ron, copying it down.",4
"“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one.",4
“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!” “What are they shouting about?,4
"“What are Death Eaters?” “It’s what You-Know- Who’s supporters called themselves,” said Bill.",4
"“Hermione,” said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, “your teeth ...” “What about them?” she said.",4
"...” “What?” She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.",4
“These disappearances seem to me to be linked.,4
Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ... pleasantly springy.,4
"Then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over.",4
"Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.",4
"Harry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.",4
"Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him.",4
"The miniature Krum walked backward and forward over Ron’s hand, scowling up at the green rosette above him.",4
"“Relashio\” Harry shouted, except that no sound came out.",4
"“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry.",4
"Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with a curly pig’s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London.",4
Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.,4
“Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort.,4
"“I’ll sort this out!” Harry didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr. Weasley.",4
"“I would have thought you’d know that, working at the Ministry!” Mr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.",4
"Cedric, Fleur, and Krum were beside the judges’ table, watching Harry sprint toward them.",4
"He wouldn’t have the brains.” “Well, what, then?” said Ron.",4
“Crouch ... that’s very — very interesting.,4
"“Forgive me, but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the World Cup is over?” “Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double-checking identities.",4
"“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,” said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves.",4
"Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half- hidden, at the back of the group.",4
"Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking around at him.",4
"He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team.",4
"“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly.",4
"She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat.",4
"As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort’s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.",4
"His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students.",4
He still hadn’t forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.,4
Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant.,4
"zey attacked me ... oh Gabrielle, I thought ...",4
“Come here.” He grabbed Harry’s arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood.,4
"“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the signature with distaste.",4
His and Ron’s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione ’s determination to pursue justice for house-elves.,4
Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily.,4
“They won’t want us visiting them now!,4
"“The Cruciatus Curse,” said Moody.",4
but I doubt he will get far.,4
"“One moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic .",4
"Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.",4
"Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask.",4
"His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort’s father grew up, and he has not been seen since last August.",4
"But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater — not that that means much.",4
“Rather thicker than one usually sees .,4
... You tell him Moody’s keeping a close eye on his son .,4
"They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.",4
"“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.",4
... We all need to go to bed.,4
"You don’t mind maroon, do you?” Dobby was delighted.",4
"Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione.",4
"“Well ... through the door, Harry,” said Dumbledore.",4
"“So.” Harry would have dearly loved to have said, “So what?” but he didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food.",4
He held his head high and went about his business as usual!,4
"The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen.",4
"Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task.” So at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs.",4
"Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry’s hand.",4
"...” “Thank you, Master ... thank you,” murmured Macnair.",4
"Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn’t look remotely beautiful now.",4
"Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead.",4
Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.,4
People usually just turn up.,4
"“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,” said Hermione haughtily.",4
"He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside  the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry’s responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.",4
"“I see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.” Hagrid ’s smile faded off his face.",4
"“You can put those away,” he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, “those books.",4
"Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes.",4
Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.,4
"Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem of his black robes.",4
"“Look after Gabrielle,” she told her, and then she turned to Harry.",4
Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to — ” Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer.,4
"I’m just going to give you some good, general advice.",4
To live up to your name?,4
"“They see this as a betrayal of our kind.” Harry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon his back, calling him a “common mule.” He wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.",5
"Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s front and back.",5
Harry and Ron both looked over.,5
"Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.",5
"“Yes, I’m starting to think he has.",5
"What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife, he saw that the blade had melted.",5
"The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him — on the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his story firsthand.",5
"Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse- P a g e | 838Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad...’ They want Arithmancy, though... You could do it, Hermione!” “I don’t much fancy banking,” said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?",5
“Well ... it’s got some interesting ...,5
"“You’re going to pay,” said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper.",5
He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive.,5
"“Is that you, Ron?” “I’m here, mate,” said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway.",5
"Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been relying on it — seeing Hagrid again had been one of the things to which he had been looking forward most.",5
"“You — you look better,” said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius.",5
"""... getting really out of hand, and you’re so good- looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn’t it, Harry?” “Oh — I dunno — ” said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.",5
"She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.",5
"in Muggle Studies... ‘Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense offunV “You’d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,” said Harry darkly.",5
"We do not recognize your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are — ” But they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them — Harry, Hermione, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing — looked around.",5
"“I’m just so — so — so tired,” she yawned.",5
Shocking- pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers.,5
"He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy — or, even better, to hit him with a good curse.",5
"“Pretty big, see.” “Where are they?” said Ron.",5
"Giants like magic, jus’ don’t like us usin’ it against ’em.",5
Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake.,5
"“Oh, I’ve always loved that owl, she’s so beautiful,” Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati.",5
The problem was going to be conveying it to the others.,5
Shut up and don’t move!” “I c-can’t see!,5
The silver- white  contents were ebbing and swirling within.,5
He was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side...,5
"“Now ... how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?” she asked, her quill poised over her clipboard.",5
Would Umbridge’s notice scare her off meeting them again?,5
They couldn’t be here... Not in Little Whinging ...,5
"“Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!” “ ‘Come and help me, Dad!",5
“Are they doctors?” he asked Ron quietly.,5
"It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn’t know what I was doing half the time, I didn’t plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help — ” Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn’t even sure why he was feeling so angry.",5
"“Get out of that one, boy!",5
"“It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry’s employ.",5
"Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood,  each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered.",5
"Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting’s over and then we’ll have dinner.",5
"Hagrid moved forward, but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian.",5
"He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep.",5
He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year.,5
People were coming back from dinner now.,5
"But who had tipped him off?”  “I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging.",5
"The High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions, and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to alter such punishments, sanctions, and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members.",5
"The straw- covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.",5
"“No,” said Harry, “no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I’m trying to make is — ”  “Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?” said Zacharias Smith.",5
Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.,5
"The floor was reflecting emerald-green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall, and a stream of witches and wizards was emerging from them.",5
"“Lording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old — ” “Now, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?”  Draco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, followed by Crabbe and Goyle.",5
"Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.",5
"He walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits.",5
"The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition .",5
"“He must be sneaking around upstairs,” he said, and without further ado pulled open the door.",5
"“That was me,” he said.",5
"Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came.",5
Possibly he had never seen his pub so full.,5
"“Make us write lines?” said George, smirking.",5
"“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered Hermione, terror in her face.",5
He was still wearing his Quidditch things.,5
KREACHER!” But Kreacher did not answer the summons.,5
"“But people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!” “Well, they were right, weren’t they?” said Hermione impatiently.",5
"He wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room, “Sirius Black!” Nothing happened.",5
The sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant were growing fainter and fainter.,5
It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them.,5
"“Yeah, look, they’re coming round now,” said George.",5
"“Right,” said James, who looked furious now, “right — There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside down in the air.",5
"“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.” Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the ground.",5
"“And was he talking back to you?” “Well ... in a manner o’ speakin’,” said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable.",5
“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously.,5
He took his revenge the only way he had: redoubling his efforts for the D.A.,5
"“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry: Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impressive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.",5
When he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.,5
“She — er — ” “Did you kiss?” asked Hermione briskly.,5
"“Haggeii” he said again, more insistently.",5
"“ ‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last night.",5
"Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by studying or homework.",5
"“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, “you can remember what your mother’s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it — ” Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting at Malfoy.",5
"It’s my house, you see.” An ugly flush suffused Snape ’s pallid face.",5
“ FlagrateV’ She drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the door.,5
"Voldemort’s got Sirius — “You are on probation!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised.",5
The street-lamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park.,5
"“Really soon, Harry,” said Hermione earnestly.",5
He had a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know when they would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid — Harry was worried that Snape’s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place.,5
"“I’ve got enough to cope with at the moment.” “Go and cope with it then!” she said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off.",5
There was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from the Slytherins’ efforts to keep Ron and the others under control.,5
"Resigned to the worst, he set off for Snape ’s office after dinner.",5
"“I didn’t say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I — ” “I know, I know,” said Angelina miserably.",5
"“Hold it,” said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him.",5
"“Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid,” said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.",5
“One ... two ... three ...” Harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel.,5
The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of D.A.,5
He swallowed his mouthful of Frog.,5
"“Let me out,” Harry said again.",5
She was frowning and muttering to herself.,5
Never met one like him.” Hermione frowned at Ron.,5
"Anyway ... First of all, Ron — I’ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother.” “Oh yeah?” said Ron, sounding apprehensive.",5
If I find a shred of evidence ...” BOOM!,5
"Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest.",5
His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs.,5
"It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.",5
"The bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight.",5
"The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.",5
"“We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore.",5
"He looks bad...” “Thank you,” said Dumbledore.",5
"Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, I’m just thrilled, oh Ronnie — ” Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron’s neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge.",5
“I was inside that snake.,5
"“Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,” said Harry angrily.",5
“Was he playing with the Snitch?” said Lupin eagerly.,5
"Then, with a swooping feeling as  though he had turned head over heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of Snape’s dungeon, and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape’s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master’s study.",5
"“I’ve been there on holiday, did you see — ?” She fell silent at the look on Ron’s face.",5
"It was a different story here: Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave.",5
The distant grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone.,5
"If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they stood.",5
"“You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color,” she said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair.",5
“You  know what to do!,5
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table.,5
"There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry’s feet.",5
"We had ter try an’ persuade some o’ the others, the ones who hadn’ wanted Golgomath as Gurg.” “How could you tell which ones they were?” asked Ron.",5
” Harry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom.,5
Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds.,5
"“You see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries.",5
"“Hogwarts prefects surely don’t wish to skive off lessons?” “Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his schedule under Fred’s nose.",5
Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it.,5
"“I don’t like him much either,” admitted Hermione, “but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say?",5
"“Well — er — hi.” The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.",5
Anyway ... why aren’t you at the feast?” Harry shrugged.,5
“I saw him at the Ministry with your dad ...” Ron’s mouth fell open.,5
Remus Lupin stood nearest to him.,5
"“Yeah ... she said ... progress will be prohibited or ... well, it meant that ... that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.” Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed, walked around her desk, and held open the door for him.",5
“Can I have a quick word?,5
“I wasn’t going to!” she shouted.,5
"Inside his head, all was icy and numb.",5
Harry and Ron goggled at her.,5
"“Inside my head, I suppose — ”  “You misunderstand me,” said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone.",5
"“Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,” said Dumbledore quietly.",5
But if he had remembered ... if he had thought about it .,5
"“Who can answer better than you?” “I was afraid of death,” said Nick.",5
At the door he looked back.,5
"And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him.",5
I am left with no alternative...,5
"But the man was stirring ... a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt...",5
"“All right, dear, let’s make it just you and me ... and we’ll take Potter too, shall we?",5
"“No, you don’t,” said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong.",5
"Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families.",5
"“Are you okay?” he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads.",5
"“That means you too, Stebbins!",5
Her blood became your refuge.,5
"“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly.",5
"“I dunno why Angelina won’t just let me resign...” “It’s because you’re good when you’re on form, that’s why,” said Harry irritably.",5
"“Let’s get out of here,” said Harry.",5
"“Last year,” Ron said, almost shouting now, “you fought off You-Know-Who again — ” “Listen to me!” said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now.",5
"“It’s Fred and George,” he said bitterly, slamming the window behind him.",5
"‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17].” Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.",5
"Tonight, eight o’clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls.",5
"“Sorry, Harry,” said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye.",5
I think we’d better knock ...” Ron rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.,5
"Harry and I will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear...” Ron strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage.",5
"“If Mum sees one of them again ...” “It’s worth the risk, that’s a major meeting they’re having,” said Fred.",5
"Sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light.",5
"“It’s no good nagging me, it’s done,” he said firmly.",5
"Voldemort raised his wand and sent another jet of green light at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak; next second he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to life too.",5
"“Students, Magorian, from up at the school!",5
"Serve them right, he thought.",5
"I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!” “There’s no market for a story like that,” said Rita coldly.",5
“Now I want you to get out of — ” They both ducked again.,5
"Right ... get inside and stay there,” she said as they reached number four.",5
“But I knew too where Voldemort was weak.,5
“Here — ”  He rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.,5
"Contact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room, for simple, part-time, virtually painless jobs (WE REGRET THAT ALL WORK IS UNDERTAKEN AT APPLICANT’S OWN RISK) “They are the limit,” said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend in October.",5
"“You read my mind,” said Fred, grinning.",5
"“OY!” But too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James’s face, spattering his robes with blood.",5
She gave each of the members of the D.A.,5
Spent a couple o’ days lyin’ low up in the cave an’ watchin’.,5
"Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of ’em woke up an’ came up where we were, an’ fer another, the snorin’ was unbelievable.",5
"The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling sound... “You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield.",5
"“Didn’t you say You-Know- Who’s got a snake, Harry?” asked Fred, looking at his father for a reaction.",5
"Fred and George sloped off to bed some time later, glowering at everyone they passed, and Ginny went not long after that.",5
Here you go — ” He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck.,5
"Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping precariously in her hand.",5
"Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was sure of it.",5
"“Maybe I’ll skive off Divination,” he said glumly as they stood again in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats.",5
Most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance...,5
Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley’s answer.,5
"I think ... we’re nearly ... yes.” Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest.",5
"Still scowling, he looked down; his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him.",5
"“Galloping gargoyles!” shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to have forgotten the exam completely.",5
"Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite noses.",5
"“It’s stressful, this managing lark, you know, I’m starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.” She was watching Ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face.",5
By-products of dirt and vileness!,5
"It was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries, and Mr. Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemort’s snake...",5
"The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks.",5
"“Can’t hear properly ... d’you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears?” “Might be worth it,” said George.",5
"I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.” “But .",5
"Was this prophecy the reason Harry’s parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar?",5
"Snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously, “Surely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter?",5
"Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand.",5
"“It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!”  “But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,” said Dumbledore.",5
“Open it!” Harry urged her.,5
"“I want you to take this,” he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry’s hands.",5
"“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear I’m going to report him, he’s only had his badge three minutes and he’s using it to bully people worse than ever... Where’s Crookshanks?” “Ginny’s got him,” said Harry.",5
Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.,5
"“Go on,” he panted, pointing his thumb at the door.",5
Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows were still raised.,5
"“But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I — persuaded him — to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.” “And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, “and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him — ” “She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore.",5
"“You wanted to see me, Headmistress?” said Snape, looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference.",5
"I mean ... blimey... Don’t want much, do they?” “Well, it’s a very responsible job, isn’t it?” said Hermione absently.",5
"“Not much left to do — they’ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we’d cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know...” “Well, you seem to know what you’re doing, at any rate,” said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard.",5
"However, the headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so ...” Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations.",5
All he wanted to do was talk over the match and Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp — not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion.,5
“What is this place anyway?” he shot at Ron and Hermione.,5
"His morning Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation, as Snape was as unpleasant as ever, and Harry’s mood was further lowered by the fact that members of the D.A.",5
"Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: It was now or never.",5
"Sirius was right, he was not a child.",5
"“All righ’, Harry!” he said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence.",5
"Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler.",5
He had to be here.,5
“They’re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them.,5
“Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes...,5
Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.,5
"“I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday evening, Potter.",5
"“We’re not discussing anything here, it’s too risky,” said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing up at the ceiling.",5
"“Doctors?” said Ron, looking startled.",5
"“Oh,” said Ron, the smile fading from his face.",5
"“Aaah ...” They sat down at the last remaining table, which was situated in the steamy window.",5
"Several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them what the sweets were going to do.",5
“Erm ... ’night.” Ron had gotten to his feet too.,5
But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!” She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stand up.,5
"“You have no subtlety, Potter,” said Snape, his dark eyes glittering.",5
"“Good-bye, Harry, take care,” said Mrs. Weasley, hugging him.",5
"memory ” muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her.",5
"“Because — ” Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come.",5
“Frightened of Dumbledore?” said Harry incredulously.,5
“See — it’s like I say — he doesn’ really know his strength — ” Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest.,5
There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish.,5
"“What did you come after me for, then?",5
"“We’ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog’s Head — ” “Idiot girl, Dumbledore won’t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry’s looking for him!” shouted Umbridge, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face.",5
"There was a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther backward, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer.",5
"“We haven’t done anything to hurt you, we haven’t used  wands or threats, we just want to go back to school, please let us go back — ” “We are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!” shouted the gray centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows.",5
"“I’m sure it will be fine.” “And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia Bones for you...” Harry smiled weakly.",5
Harry could not see why.,5
"“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer, “ The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.” “Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality.",5
"Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, Hermione’s wand held fast in his trembling hand.",5
"Would he be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage?",5
"Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying.",5
"“Then we are in agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?” “If there were dementors, which I doubt — ” “You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore interrupted.",5
“A gorgeous centaur ...” sighed Parvati.,5
It did nothing to improve his temper.,5
“I don’t suppose you do.,5
"As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below.",5
The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent.,5
"“Something blibbering, no doubt,” said Hermione under her breath, and Neville gave a nervous little laugh.",5
I see Tonks isn’t on here.,5
"But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted — ” “He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to,” Harry said shortly.",5
"Leave him alone.” “I will if you go out with me, Evans,” said James quickly.",5
"Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: He had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.",5
"“Yeah, all right,” said Harry, looking around.",5
"If he could only perform Legilimency and open  a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein... Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool.",5
"“It’s supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours — Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can’t hurt — ” “This stuff can,” said Hermione grimly.",5
"“The boy — the boy will have to stay, Vernon,” she said weakly.",5
She was much too close.,5
"“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a falsely anxious voice.",5
“How are you feeling?” Harry shrugged.,5
"He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realized he still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school.",5
Fred and George handed them around.,5
Once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams.,5
I’m writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.,5
There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts — Snape.,5
"Instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle of a meadow — she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later squashed into the painting next door, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her.",5
“But I know exactly where.,5
"That’ll tell you all you need to know.” “Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped Seamus.",5
"“And you, Harry — ” Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall.",5
"If only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think... “Oho!",5
"It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry.",5
"“No need,” he said shortly.",5
The only sound was that of Hermione’s quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table.,5
"“We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging other than Harry Potter,” said Madam Bones at once.",5
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over.,5
"Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were  sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head.",5
“Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated.,5
"Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf.",5
"“Just try and push with your legs — ” He gave another stupendous heave and Neville’s robes tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of  them could catch it, one of Neville’s floundering feet kicked it.",5
"I’ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry’s best interests at heart — ” “He’s not your son,” said Sirius quietly.",5
"“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.",5
“A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions ...,5
This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.” Harry felt as though something was closing in upon him.,5
Hermione heaved a very deep sigh.,5
DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE’S HOUSE.,5
He was in a state of shock.,5
It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy.,5
"“Sirius’s brother was a Death Eater, wasn’t he?",5
Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would listen.,5
Harry thrust his fist in the air.,5
"“Potter, what do you think you’re doing?” “I need to see Professor McGonagall,” gasped Harry, the breath tearing his lungs.",5
"His comeback didn’t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see.",5
“It was — ” Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore.,5
"“Too right it has,” said Harry.",5
"It was real, I didn’t imagine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone’s got to find out where he is...” Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing.",5
"“Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people — ” Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts), neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair.",5
Can we go in here?” Harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.,5
"Taking great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him.",5
"They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart when Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin.",5
"He got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror — But then an idea struck him... A better idea than a mirror ... A much bigger, more important idea .",5
"Now, seeing the memory again, he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr. Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry.",5
All that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil.,5
“If you care about exam results anyway.,5
"“Come on, let’s get a carriage together before they all fillup...” “I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied coach.",5
The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment.,5
"“Get up, you useless lump, get up!” But Dudley either could not or would not move.",5
"He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.",5
"Hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often.",5
"“Why’s he all right, then?” blustered Uncle Vernon.",5
“Arrested for trying to get through a door.,5
"“Harry, mate,” said Ron uncertainly, “you ... you were just dreaming...” “No!” said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand.",5
"“I’m getting sick of my scar hurting, and I’m getting bored walking down that corridor every night.” He rubbed his forehead angrily.",5
"“Now, really!” said Professor Tofty anxiously.",5
It looked old; it was certainly dirty.,5
"Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence.",5
"Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things?”  “As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge dismissively.",5
“I was — trying to get my Firebolt!” Harry croaked.,5
On the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully.,5
"“It wasn’t me\ It was a couple of dementors!” “A couple of — what’s this codswallop?” “De — men — tors,” said Harry slowly and clearly.",5
He could hear distant footsteps.,5
He did not understand why Sirius was not here.,5
Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done ...,5
"“Silenciol” said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry’s frog, which deflated silently before them.",5
"They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of the forest.",5
I wonder whether this has been put up in all the Houses?” It was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridge’s sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower.,5
"Tall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes staring ... Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move.",5
"He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time.",5
You will have your chance to rage at me — to do whatever you like — when I have finished.,5
"“Damn it,” he added angrily, putting a hand up to the magical eye, “it keeps sticking — ever since that scum wore it — ” And with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.",5
Harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor.,5
"There were no good hiding places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment.",5
"“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks.",5
"“I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,” Lupin continued.",5
The light was dimmer than it had been by day.,5
“We’re not going through clouds!” shouted Tonks angrily.,5
"The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then snaked under the door.",5
Ron and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes.,5
"But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.” “Who heard it?” asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already.",5
"From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and deposited them in the basin.",5
"“I’ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,” he said mechanically.",5
"He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James’s nor Harry’s could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn’t seem to have noticed.",5
"He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.",5
Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place.,5
They won’t print a story that shows Harry in a good light.,5
"He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh floor and the Fat Lady’s portrait.",5
"“Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys.” “What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the monocle’s edges disappeared into her flesh.",5
Dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs.,5
"If he, Harry, had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort’s trick, if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as Hermione had said, banking on Harry’s love of playing the hero .",5
"“It’s none of your business if Harry’s been with a hundred girls,” Hermione told Rita coolly.",5
"Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, thought we could turn you normal, but you’ve been rotten from the beginning, and I’ve had enough — OWLS!”  The fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech.",5
This is a lie.” “It is NOT a lie!” said Harry.,5
"“She knows.” “She can’t,” said Ron at once.",5
“It’s that Umbridge woman!” “Who?” said Hermione.,5
"They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible.",5
"“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage, it’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry.",5
He chanced another glance out of the window.,5
"“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?” “Yeah,” said Harry.",5
"“You don’t even try to listen to him, do you?” “We do try,” said Ron.",5
Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office.,5
"I’ll see you all later... Little Ronnie, a prefect!",5
"“You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, by Inigo Imago.",5
And anyway ... remember Norbert?,5
"“Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears — ” “Yeah?” growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside.",5
"“Well — now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea... He’s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in .",5
"“Keep in touch.” “Harry, we’ll have you away from there as soon as we can,” Mrs. Weasley whispered, hugging him again.",5
"The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than in months.",5
"“Reparo\” said Hermione quickly, mending Ron’s cup with a wave of her wand.",5
He looked around and saw her watching him.,5
"“Well — that’d explain it.”  “Has Ron saved a goal yet?” asked Hermione, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms.",5
“I won’t bother in future.,5
The Burrow?” Harry asked hopefully.,5
"“He’s not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof — ”  “Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,” said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look.",5
"“In!” she said furiously, pointing to the door.",5
"“Professor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir!” He sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered onto the arm of Harry’s chair.",5
"“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d do, let them starve?” Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.",5
"He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it’s the kind of thing he does, he knows you’re the — the sort of person who’d go to Sirius’s aid!",5
Disregarding this completely he stared avidly at Harry.,5
"“Just thinking ...” she said, still frowning at the rain- washed window.",5
"“ Impedimental ” he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was knocked off his feet, halfway through a dive toward his own fallen wand.",5
"His four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft... “Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,” said Dumbledore.",5
“You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament?,5
"“I can’t, they’re not technically doing anything wrong,” said Hermione through gritted teeth.",5
His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.,5
"“And I’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,” said Lupin.",5
"“Sirius, sit down.” Mrs. Weasley’s lower lip was trembling.",5
They sat side by side in  silence for a moment.,5
"“I haven’t tried that before... Didn’t realize it would be quite so ... Don’t worry,  though, Stinksap’s not poisonous,” he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor.",5
"“Wait ... Harry, they can help.” Harry and Ron looked at her.",5
"His scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage.",5
The Wizengamot were filing out.,5
“But members of the Inquisitorial Squad — ” “The what?” said Hermione sharply.,5
"He was five, watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle, and his heart was bursting with jealousy...",5
"Harry  heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.",5
"Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom.",5
"“An interview?” repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher than ever.",5
"We’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge.",5
"He’s a good lad, really... I’ve bin thinkin’ abou’ tryin’ ter find him a lady friend, actually...” Harry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once.",5
"She was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day.",5
"Or even looked at me.” And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it.",5
Hagrid ’s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again.,5
Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.,5
"“Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snake’s got in its fangs, and Arthur’s learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven’t you, dear?” she added, rather menacingly.",5
"Why hadn’t they spoken to him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now?",5
"The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than before.",5
"“ ‘The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings- on at Hogwarts for some time,’ said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley.",5
"He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way... “It is a pity it broke,” said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.",5
“And Kreacher told you all this .,5
“You do not see the flaw in the plan yet?,5
"He caught Harry’s eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his chest.",5
"Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets, and food from the pantry.",5
"Bill’s sitting with him now, he’s going to take the morning off work.” Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face.",5
"“It ... did that mean ... What did that mean?”  “It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago.",5
"Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.",5
"Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points...",5
“Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?,5
It remained as firmly shut as ever.,5
"“Yes, it hurts, doesn’t it?” she said softly.",5
Just like it says on the floor guide.,5
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read.,5
"“You don’t have much of a tan.” “Yeah ... well ... sensitive skin,” said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile.",5
"A few students joined in, but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.",5
"“Fawkes!” said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment.",5
"“You weren’t ordering Dungbombs, were you?” “No,” said Harry.",5
"If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.",5
They altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye ’s instructions.,5
"He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, “Look .",5
"The Dark Arts Outsmarted ... Self-Defensive Spellwork ... wow ...” She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they  were doing was right.",5
"“Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy...” “I DOE YOU HAB!” roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor’s encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, “Someone Stun him!” “No, no, no,” said Bellatrix.",5
"Neville jumped down, shaking, but Luna dismounted smoothly.",5
"“Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius — you know, Lucius Malfoy — so don’t come up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you again — ” “All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius.",5
"Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain.",5
"Then she said baldly, “The Prophet wouldn’t print it.",5
“He came back a month ago.,5
Mrs. Black’s portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again anyway.,5
"“Sorry Sirius, mate — didn’t mean to — ” Harry and Sirius were both laughing.",5
"He looked down at his right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin.",5
"She followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and interest.",5
"They have probably already profited from the traitor F irenze ’s teachings ...” “Nevertheless,” said Magorian calmly, “the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime... We do not touch the innocent.",5
"At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.",5
"“Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn’t had the manners to return my best one...",5
Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.,5
"Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if that were true.” She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully.",5
"“A couple of people ?” “Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,” said Hermione happily.",5
"Shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering “Umbridge-itis.” After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating, and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.",5
"“I can’t think why they’re doing it down there — unless — but no ...” A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate.",5
She moved forward to look through the side of the tank.,5
"“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer.",5
"“Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.” “Why?” “Well, we’re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat.” She sighed heavily.",5
“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.,5
"“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly.",5
"However, her troubles were far from over.",5
"They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron.",5
He seemed to be limping.,5
"A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately.",5
Fred’s mouth fell open too.,5
"It felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia’s surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of- the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon.",5
“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.,5
"Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom.",5
"Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet Drive — ” She caught her breath, horrified.",5
"The spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had — she was already on her feet again, breathless, no longer laughing.",5
"confusing was the word, all right; why did he know what Voldemort was feeling?",5
"One — two — ” A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed, Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made.",5
Nothing to worry about ... old news ...,5
Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?,5
"She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone.",5
"“And I saw that,” he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.",5
"When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual — ” “Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,” said Dumbledore steadily, “but as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said.",5
“How come you’ve landed yourself in detention for five o’clock on Friday?” “What?” said Harry.,5
He had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees  toward the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them.,5
"“Sorry, Professor,” he panted, as he closed the door.",5
If only his scar would stop prickling ... then he would be able to think more clearly.,5
"They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.",5
"“Calm down, you two,” he said, turning to walk on while they panted along behind him.",5
"I expect Ginny’s asleep,” she added to Hermione, “so try not to wake her up.” “Asleep, yeah, right,” said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them good night and they were climbing to the next floor.",5
"“Is this true?” “Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had intended.",5
"Here you are.” She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point.",5
"“But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from here.",5
"""... naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it?",5
"You’re still very pale...” “I’m fine,” he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag.",5
"“Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night!” “She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney’s,” said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.",5
"But unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.” “Well, you’re just going to have to break your promise, that’s all,” said Ron firmly.",5
"DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY “Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry.",5
"What’s more, the Ministry’s leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they’re calling Dumbledore’s rumormongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything’s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they’re using the Imperius Curse.” “But you’re telling people, aren’t you?” said Harry, looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks.",5
"Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials.",5
"Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the sun put in a feeble  appearance before clouds drifted over it once more.",5
"Behind the dais there were still flashes of light, grunts, and cries — Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius’s duel with Bellatrix.",5
"It will mean a lot more study even after you’ve left school, so unless you’re prepared to — ” “I think you’ll also find,” said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, “that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors.",5
"“I think you 11 find him suitable.”  “I’ll bet you wish you hadn’t given up Divination now, don’t you, Hermione?” asked Parvati, smirking.",5
"that one of us has got to kill the other one ... in the end?” “Yes,” said Dumbledore.",5
"Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn’t speaking any language we recognize yet... Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I’ll leave you all to chat...” Harry looked around; this ward bore unmistakable signs of being a permanent home to its residents.",5
"The confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already... Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted...",5
He smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him.,5
Mrs. Black’s screaming had stopped again.,5
“Aquavirius maggots!” said Luna excitedly.,5
when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night ...” “The Malfoys — undoubtedly on Voldemort’s instructions — had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured.,5
"“Arthur, back me up!” Mr. Weasley did not speak at once.",5
Mrs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.,5
"“She should have told us she’d jinxed that list — ” “I think it was a brilliant idea,” said Harry coldly.",5
"“She hated him!” “Nah, she didn’t,” said Sirius.",5
"“George,” said Fred, “I think we’ve outgrown full-time education.” “Yeah, I’ve been feeling that way myself,” said George lightly.",5
"“A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge.",5
"“Tha’s gotta be better, hasn’ it?” Harry shrugged.",5
"“Very well, Mr. Potter ...",5
"“How many times?” Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness.",5
“You look ever so pale... Are you sure you slept this morning?,5
"“So that’s why they killed him,” she said quietly, withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last.",5
“Some o’ the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.” “And how many were there?” asked Harry.,5
"If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all...",5
Harry’s head throbbed more painfully.,5
"How is that fair, how?” “I know, mate,” said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry’s plate, “she’s bang out of order.” Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing.",5
"“I absolutely forbid — ” “Molly, you can’t stop Fred and George,” said Mr. Weasley wearily.",5
"Yeh know, she’s a fine, well-dressed woman, an’ knowin’ where we was goin’ I wondered ’ow she’d feel abou’ clamberin’ over boulders an’ sleepin’ in caves an’ tha’, bu’ she never complained once.” “You knew where you were going?” Harry asked.",5
"Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something — perhaps Azkaban — had taken most of her beauty.",5
"Harry saw him double over and thought for a moment that he had finally been overcome by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back — then Harry realized that Fang’s limp body was draped around his shoulders.",5
"“Here you are, Agnes,” said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents.",5
"“There can be no return from such disgrace.” “If yeh say so,” said Hagrid, shrugging, “but personally I think yeh ’re makin’ a big mistake — ” “As are you, human,” said Bane, “coming back into our forest when we warned you — ” “Now, you listen ter me,” said Hagrid angrily.",5
“It would’ve been really annoying if you hadn’t explained yourself properly.” Hermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he was there.,5
"“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron’s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark.",5
Harry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting.,5
"Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of invisible dementors?” Percy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.",5
"Pumpkin juice?” As she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk.",5
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect...” Harry gave a small snort of laughter.,5
"The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville’s head as he emerged — his foot broke Neville’s wand in two and connected with his face — Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose.",5
He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.,5
"“Something he’s been hoping for.” The words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry’s mouth, yet he knew they were true.",5
"“Is Hedwig okay?” asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was within earshot.",5
Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.,5
"You think you’ve had it bad, at least you’ve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights... I’ve been stuck inside for a month.” “How come?” asked Harry, frowning.",5
"Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook.",5
"There was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him.",5
“What have you done to my son?” he said in a menacing growl.,5
“Did you see it?” “D’you reckon she knows?” “What are we going to do?” They were all looking at Harry.,5
"“Anyway — it doesn’t matter — Sirius won’t care if it’s unusual, he’ll come back, I know he will!”  And so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward him.",5
"His mother and father were beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths.",5
Harry raised his own wand.,5
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably.,5
"He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents.",5
"Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging his trunk.",5
"“Oh no ... Sirius!” “What’s happened?” said Harry, and he snatched at the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione were holding half each.",5
"The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he could find nothing to criticize.",5
"Even Voldemort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.” “You didn’t leave your bed, mate,” said Ron.",5
"She looked very offended, as did several of the people surrounding her.",5
"He had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could help him save Sirius, were gone — but he had been wrong.",5
"“So,” said Harry, “what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway?” He could not think what to do but to keep talking.",5
"He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man’s flesh, feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood...",5
An’ when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an’ his head was lyin’ at the bottom o’ the lake.” “Whose head?” gasped Hermione.,5
"Hermione ’s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to which Harry was looking forward least and which he was sure would be the one that would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror.",5
"“Ron’s just got to have some breakfast.” It became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms.",5
"I think I’m feeling a bit ... rebellious.” Harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and Ron went up to bed an hour  later, and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word POO.",5
"“Well — I have talked about it,” Harry said in a whisper, “to Ron and Hermione, but — ” “Oh, you’ll talk to Hermione Granger!” she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart to stare.",5
"I can’t find a seat...” “What are you talking about?” said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him.",5
Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser.,5
Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs.,5
"“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind.",5
For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food.,5
"Ron’s smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain.",5
"“If you’ve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can be moved, stop your mummy worrying — ” “Leave my mother out of this, Potter!”  “What’s going on?” Ron had appeared in the doorway.",5
"He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand.",5
"“Floo powder?” “No,” said Dumbledore, “Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched.",5
He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there.,5
"“She — er — might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake — ”  “Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,” said Angelina glumly, as Fred and George zoomed off toward the castle supporting Katie between them.",5
"TRAGIC DEMISE OF MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER  St. Mungo’s Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by a potted-plant.",5
"Especially,” Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars shone pearly white, “Professor Umbridge.”  He expected the elf’s smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say that this was impossible, or else that he would try, but his hopes were not high... What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling happily, and clap his hands together.",5
“He’s still god be!” Harry’s heart sank.,5
The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches.,5
"He tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment, and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them.",5
“Not so much as a warning!,5
"“Just try and stand, let’s get out of — ” “ Dubbledorel” said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry’s shoulder.",5
"“ — a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house and I won’t have it, boy, I won’t — ” “I can’t stop the owls coming,” Harry snapped, crushing Sirius’s letter in his fist.",5
Harry was reminded forcibly of the time that Ron had accidentally put a slug- vomiting charm on himself.,5
"“You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife, children, and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly.",5
“Oh — sorry — ” He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes.,5
Harry did not need telling twice.,5
Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione’s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns ’s voice.,5
"“Was it — was it you-know- what, darling?",5
"“It’s not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame!",5
"“WHERE HAGGER?” “I don’t know!” squealed Hermione, terrified.",5
"It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all.",5
"“Not far from here,” grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers.",5
She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face.,5
"Professor Umbridge was standing stock-still, staring at Dumbledore, who continued to smile benignly.",5
Fred and I have been developing them this summer.,5
Who yeh bin talkin’ to?,5
"“This is it!” He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light.",5
"Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.",5
"“Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that — ” Snape opened his mouth in a snarl — and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room.",5
"“We agreed, I think, what we would do if this human showed his face in the forest again?” “ This human’ now, am I?” said Hagrid testily.",5
Everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmaster’s absence.,5
"Dear Snuffles, Hope you’re okay, the first week back here’s been terrible, I’m really glad it’s the weekend.",5
"She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth.",5
“It’s bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything!” Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes.,5
"How about ‘pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited’?”  “Well, what does that mean?” said Ron impatiently.",5
"A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword.",5
“Doesn’t stop him being a git.,5
"“Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.” They did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-size vase on its other side.",5
"The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at humans of any description.",5
"“Of course,” said Hermione coolly.",5
"Fifth years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o’clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way up to the seventh floor.",5
Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets.,5
Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of their wings.,5
"“You’re inspectin’ us?” Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her.",5
“Evidence?” repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike smile.,5
"He could feel Professor Marchbanks’s eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower.",5
“Hey — hey you lot!,5
Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode.,5
"“What kept you?” he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione ’s.",5
"Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider’s account of life in Azkaban...” Rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione ’s drink and thrust it up her nose.",5
‘Tm not sure you are!” said Mrs. Weasley.,5
"“She’s going out with —  my sister’s going — what d’you mean, Michael Corner?” “Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think — well, they’re obviously interested in learning defense, but if Ginny hadn’t told Michael what was going on — “When did this — when did she — ?” “They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last year,” said Hermione composedly.",5
"I can do it at last... They’ve had it coming to them for years...” He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.",5
"However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas — ” “The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?” “Do not interrupt me, Potter,” said Snape in a dangerous voice.",5
"“Why aren’t you in class?” “I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly.",5
"I think I’m going mad... Back in Dumbledore’s office, just before we took the Portkey .",5
"“Lumos.” A wand tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light.",5
"“REMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.” Aunt Petunia looked as though she might faint.",5
"Harry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate.",5
"“Ron!” croaked Harry, dashing toward them.",5
"And I’ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.” If anything more was needed to complete Harry’s happiness, it was Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s reactions.",5
"They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.",5
"“Hmm,” said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, “I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid’s very extended leave of absence?” Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly.",5
"Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley — ” “ — Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,” said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck.",5
“What’re those things?” whispered Ron.,5
"If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight.",5
“How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder?,5
Tonks was already unbuckling Harry’s trunk.,5
"Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.",5
And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him?,5
Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney’s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary.,5
"For some reason many of them waved at Ron, laughing uproariously.",5
"“It takes a full moon cycle to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month.” “A month?” squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly.",5
"“All those poor elves I haven’t set free yet, having to stay over during Christmas because there aren’t enough hats!” Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay.",5
When the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge’s office again.,5
"“Sorry, I only — ” “Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize — “Ron — ” “I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m up to my neck in it here — ” “No — look!” Hermione was pointing to the nearest window.",5
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean.,5
“Er — thestralsl” he said loudly.,5
Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off.,5
"Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned.",5
His and Cho’s eyes met for a moment.,5
"“The rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them.",5
"Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking.",5
"I don’t like Occlumency much...” “I expect anyone would feel shaky if they’d had their mind attacked over and over again,” said Hermione sympathetically.",5
"Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, “ STUPEFY !” The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater’s shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses.",5
"“Er ... yeah,” said Harry untruthfully.",5
"“So what have you two been doing, if you’re not allowed in meetings?” he demanded.",5
"“THERE WAS NO NEED — IVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU’RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DONT HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!” “We were just trying to save a bit of time!” said Fred, hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table.",5
"“We’re bein’ watched, Ron,” he said gruffly.",5
"“I forgot the hellebore...” “I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless.",5
"“Oh, I think it is,” growled Moody, who had limped a little closer.",5
"The Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well enough; Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of Jupiter’s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice.",5
He wondered bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.,5
"“Nothing, Arthur,” said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance.",5
"One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron’s tryout.",5
"“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge.",5
"“Shut the door behind you, Potter.” Harry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself as he did so.",5
The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.,5
“In fact ...” He stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backward.,5
"Luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita’s interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.",5
"He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort’s mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape.",5
"Sorry, Molly.” The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.",5
"“Oh no, thank you very much,” said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much.",5
"“In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see.",5
"“So,” said Sirius, “how are you organizing this group?",5
“I expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.” “What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly.,5
"“Thanks,” he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks ’s ears with his left hand.",5
Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin.,5
"I’m sorry I gave you such a miserable time, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they’d thought you enjoyed it.",5
“We know you didn’t do anything because we wanted you to — ” But nobody seemed to be listening to him.,5
"“Yooooul” she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man.",5
"“As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, ‘Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.",5
"Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale.",5
"“After you’d watched him rip off another giant’s head?” “ ’Course we did,” said Hagrid, “we hadn’ gone all that way ter give up after two days!",5
"I just wondered what Sirius thought,” she said, shrugging.",5
Good day to you.” The happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated.,5
"“Dobby?” said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom toward the source of the voice.",5
"The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter ... or at least, most minds are...” He smirked.",5
"“I would also advise — ” Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time.",5
"I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge again.” “What private business have they got together anyway?” “Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily.",5
"“Hagrid, why are you armed?” said Harry.",5
"You’re in shock, Harry; you’re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died.",5
"Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting?",5
I must not tell lies.,5
"“Well, I don’t think Snape should stop until you’re absolutely sure you can control them!” said Hermione indignantly.",5
“There — there wasn’t time for him to say anything.,5
The cartoon was captioned: How Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts?,5
"“That’s the worst Monday I’ve ever seen.” “Fair point, little bro,” said Fred, scanning the column.",5
Harry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place.,5
"Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.",5
"Harry felt a thrill of dread: He was about to pay for what had just happened, he was sure of it.",5
"“Well, Potter, you know why you are here,” he said.",5
Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix’s jet of red light: He was laughing at her.,5
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class and pulled out parchment, quills, and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.",5
"“What now?” he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.",5
"“Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,” he said, prodding his queen forward toward Harry’s quivering castle.",5
"“Who’s ‘she,’ Dobby?” But he thought he knew — surely only one “she” could induce such fear in Dobby?",5
"“Well that’s not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?” But Hermione said, “What do you mean ‘at one point,’ Hagrid?” Hagrid looked at her sadly.",5
"meetings, and regular classes with Snape — January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast.",5
"With a look of grim satisfaction Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: The clinking noise slowed  and died, and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze, and vanished.",5
"“Remember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him?",5
“But ... how do you know?” said Ron.,5
“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon.,5
"“What sort of things did you hear, popkin?” breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.",5
"“You jest, Harry Potter.” “Nope, not jesting,” said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape.",5
"“They want loads of them, won’t take no for an answer!",5
For once her pouchy toad’s eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students.,5
"“No point at all, we answered ourselves.",5
"When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library.",5
"“Well, like I say, they’re not meant ter live together, giants,” said Hagrid sadly.",5
"She had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green almond-shaped eyes — Harry’s eyes.",5
"There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth.",5
"“But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement.” “We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,” said George brightly, “now that we’ve got — ” He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.",5
"“Me,” said Ron, who was still rather disheveled.",5
"Ron and Hermione left before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from her.",5
Neville was having trouble too.,5
“And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?” said Phineas.,5
"“You sound like Molly,” said Sirius.",5
"He stepped down onto the platform and looked around, listening for the familiar call of “Firs’ years over here ... firs’ years ...”  But it did not come.",5
He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand.,5
"“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon.",5
“I got company fer yeh!” Hagrid shouted.,5
The silver door knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent.,5
"Kingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon Harry what Dumbledore was about to do, and he could not let it happen.",5
"The elf straightened up, eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.",5
"“Can’t anyone else hear it?” Harry demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put it there, he found his foot was on the dais.",5
"You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you.",5
"“Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,” said Hermione in a tense voice.",5
"“Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, Harry?” “Ron, get out of the way, get down — ” But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank.",5
"Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,” before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum...” At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.",5
He walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it.,5
"She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville.",5
"“But tha’s not very interestin’, Hermione,” said Hagrid.",5
"“How do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter?” said Snape.",5
"“Just for trying to get through a door!” “Don’t be silly, it wasn’t just for trying to get through a door — what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in the morning?” breathed Hermione.",5
"You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you.",5
"“I’m going, I’m going!” And with another loud crack, he vanished.",5
"Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.",5
"“You can make some more, can’t you?” she said, her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious.",5
"“When, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort’s.",5
"“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner.",5
“My dad’s Muggle-born  and he’s a right old slob.,5
Harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting.,5
"“Let’s get this straight,” said Harry angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, “Sirius agrees with us, so you don’t think we should do it anymore?” Hermione looked tense and rather miserable.",5
"Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.",5
"Was Harry Potter having bad dreams?” “Not really bad,” said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes.",5
"“Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn’t care about seeing hurt — ” “You know what, I’ve just thought of something,” said Ron in a hushed voice.",5
"It’d take her about ten more seconds — hey, Hagrid!” Hagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass.",5
"Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He got off, he got off he got off — ” “That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too was smiling.",5
"“Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of — den,” said Hermione.",5
"“Hermione, it was your idea in the first place!” said Ron indignantly.",5
It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.,5
"It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off.",5
"And then there’s his Umgubular Slashkilter — ” “Don’t ask,” Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled.",5
"“Now, I haven’t heard from Dumbledore lately!” she added, peering around the hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard.",5
"they’re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world... You think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected?” “I dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!” Harry shouted.",5
"He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.” “Only Dad wasn’t,” said Fred grimly.",5
“ — so we’re not hard ter follow.,5
"“We recognized Harry’s voice — what are you yelling about?” “Never you mind,” said Harry roughly.",5
I must not tell lies.,5
"“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger.",5
"He stooped a little (the centaurs’ arms tensed on their bows) and then bellowed, “HAGGER!” A few of the centaurs looked worried now.",5
"“Trip Jinx, Potter!” he said.",5
Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.,5
Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside.,5
"And your son’s sent an owl to say he’s visiting tonight, so that’s nice, isn’t it?” Agnes gave several loud barks.",5
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around.",5
Harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square.,5
"“But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back” (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), “he has more right than most to — ” “He’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!” said Mrs. Weasley.",5
"She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily.",5
"Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him.",5
Harry approached a door at random and pushed.,5
"Hagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling.",5
"His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, “I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.” Harry spun around.",5
"“And why,” said Snape slowly, “would you ask such a thing?” “Because,” said Harry, watching Snape closely for a reaction, “that corridor I’ve just seen — I’ve been dreaming about it for months — I’ve just recognized it — it leads to the Department of Mysteries .",5
"“Another Remembrall?” said Harry, remembering the marblelike device Neville’s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory.",5
"“I could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasn’t sure whether I had the authority...”  Beaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face.",5
"“It’s bizarre,” said Fred, frowning around at it.",5
"“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her.",5
"Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying...",5
"“Well, yes,” said Umbridge, still smiling.",5
Malfoy mouthed “Remedial Potions?” at Harry behind Snape ’s back before following him.,5
"“Maybe it’s a bit like an illness,” said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron.",5
"In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below.",5
"From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out.",5
"“I don’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?” “I’ve used it against him,” said Harry quietly.",5
"“What am I supposed to be looking at?” “At the — there, between the shafts!",5
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.,5
"Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised.",5
"“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst.",5
"“Now, how many autographs would you like?",5
"‘Many of us with our children’s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’ “Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.",5
It might even be painless.,5
They had expected to have to comb Hermione’s Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter.,5
"“She said you got enough attention as it was.” “She’s not wrong,” mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed.",5
The thought made his stomach clench painfully.,5
“You might as well take Harold Dingle’s powdered dragon claw and have done with it.” “Dingle’s got powdered dragon claw?” said Ron eagerly.,5
“It could be a frame-up!” Ron exclaimed excitedly.,5
The thestral’s head was suddenly pointing toward the ground and he had actually slid forward a few inches along its neck.,5
"Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued?” As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something.",5
"The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth-telling...”  Snape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to communicate without words.",5
She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table.,5
“But — Harry ...” said Ron weakly.,5
"Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter, Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee.",5
"“What?” said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him.",5
"“Not with Umbridge there.” “Reckon they know anything new?” said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers.",5
None of this added up.,5
"He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last...",5
He turned the mirror over.,5
"“People take them and hide them, you know.",5
"“That’s Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family too, he was a great wizard ... Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young ... Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found his body ... Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever ... Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat .",5
"“Ron, Ginny!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward and hugging her children tightly.",5
"“I really like you, Harry.” He could not think.",5
"Perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really deserved it .",5
"Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: Nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught.",5
"“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” Ron told Harry in a tense voice.",5
I can’t play to save my life.,5
"His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk.",5
"The way he looks at us when he sees us...” “Bill doesn’t like him either,” said Ginny, as though that settled the matter.",5
"“Who else has he got?” “He’s got me!” “Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling.",5
The kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey.,5
"Have a seat, Harry, doesn’t look as if Perkins is in yet.” Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins’s desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him.",5
"She was watching him, her wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.",5
"Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley, and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor.",5
Then they saw that his waist joined smoothly with a horse’s chestnut body.,5
"For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age.",5
"“And Katie, can’t you do something about that nosebleed?” “It’s just getting worse!” said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve.",5
"Squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore  had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else.",5
“I could sneak upstairs and get a pair — ” But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary.,5
We were hopeful when we left that day.,5
"“Clear night,” grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens.",5
“Stop — stop - STOP!” screamed Angelina.,5
"“You to come and find me,” said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds.",5
"Harry, Ginny, and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish.",5
"Ron was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell.",5
He would do better to abandon it.” “His attempt is not working?” Harry repeated blankly.,5
"On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the second from his cousin.",5
"He’s certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.” “So you’re trying to stop him getting more followers?” “We’re doing our best,” said Lupin.",5
He was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair.,5
"Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which he was grateful.",5
"“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?” Professor Umbridge asked Snape.",5
"The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks.",5
Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there.,5
"Harry bent his knees  and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed to be completely empty.",5
"“There isn’t any ‘in there,’ it’s just an archway, there’s no room for anybody to be there — Harry, stop it, come away — ”  She grabbed his arm and pulled, but he resisted.",5
"“Get Potter!” shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him.",5
"“To send a letter,” said Hermione, swinging her bag onto her shoulder.",5
"“She works for Fudge?” Hermione repeated, frowning.",5
“I need scarcely say that I failed dismally.” Harry’s mood suddenly lifted.,5
There were only three patients.,5
"And it had been Seamus’s very first meeting ... and Neville had been getting so good... “Fizzing Whizbee,” sang Umbridge, and the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase.",5
"but no ... a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping onto his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark.",5
"Ginny said, “Somebody else could have told us... We could have heard it somewhere other than Harry...” “Like who?” said Sirius impatiently.",5
"“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we’ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who’s back.” “Look,” said Hermione, intervening swiftly, “that’s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about — ” “It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry.",5
"“My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.” “You ran away from home?” “When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius.",5
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.,5
"“And, of course, that’ll be a very important story, so Harry’s might have to wait for the following issue,” said Luna.",5
"“The shoes don’t prevent you reading, do they?” said the blonde witch irritably, pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk.",5
“This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster.,5
"Nevertheless, he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time...",5
“He can’t be allowed to dock points ... that would be ridiculous...,5
They were trapped and outnumbered two to one.,5
It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they’re superior to other creatures...”  Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill’s hair.,5
“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough?,5
"“Sounded like a load of waffle to me.” “There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,” said Hermione grimly.",5
“It is not good!” said Hermione hotly.,5
"“Warrington’s aim’s so pathetic I’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,” he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson’s face.",5
"The Hog’s Head Inn, which Sibyll chose for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks.",5
"“And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius.",5
"In this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing himself at last — or else you would have to take it for him.",5
"“I know,” said Hermione, twisting her fingers together.",5
"“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping...” Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.",5
"He has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir... And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and — ” “ — and if you really needed a bathroom,” said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, “would it fill itself with chamber pots?” “Dobby expects so, sir,” said Dobby, nodding earnestly.",5
I mean — ” She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expression on his face.,5
It’s about making sure we really can defend ourselves.,5
"He had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked, Dumbledore seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.",5
"“Well ... down ter him, where he was lyin’ in the valley.",5
"“Well, I on’y jus’ got back,” said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack.",5
"My only defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.” Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.",5
"“Well, then, I am confused... I’m afraid I don’t quite understand how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that — ” “False hope?” repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge.",5
Harry interrupted her before she had even started.,5
"He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair.",5
Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.,5
A few more of the portraits had stirred now.,5
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all.,5
"As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it.",5
"“Dear, dear,” said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame.",5
"“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter.",5
"“This,” said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood, “is Harry, Grawp!",5
"“Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can’t throw it out.” “Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master’s house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it’s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it — ” “I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall.",5
The stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.,5
"“I had a — a kind of — vision...” And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes... Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak.",5
"You need to really want to cause pain — to enjoy it — righteous anger won’t hurt me for long — I’ll show you how it is done, shall I?",5
Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out of his head.,5
"I — don’t — believe — him!” “We haven’t got to do anything yet!” Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back toward the castle.",5
"She was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.",5
"“It happens, sometimes ... when somebody has suffered a ... loss.” “Well,” said Harry, refusing to be deflected.",5
Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.,5
"“I wish you to have a drink with me,” she said, her voice becoming more dangerously sweet.",5
They were whispering excitedly together.,5
"“On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog’s Head Inn.",5
Harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term.,5
"“The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James.” “Look — ” “Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,” said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying.",5
"Harry watched him go, wondering how much more bad news he could stand.",5
"Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class.",5
"“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she asked.",5
"” Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again.",5
"“Quite correct,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet.",5
"“Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,” said Sirius.",5
"“And this is Nymphadora — ” “ Don’t call me Nymphadora, Remus,” said the young witch with a shudder.",5
"“I don’t think you understood the question, did you, dear?",5
"“It’s more like ... his mood, I suppose.",5
"She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip.",5
"You think you’ll be where I am, don’t you, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!” “You are raving,” said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful.",5
“My gran’s always said You- Know-Who would come back one day.,5
"“Yes, it was rather horrible,” said Luna conversationally.",5
"Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table,  which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE — NEW PREFECTS.",5
“They keep slipping in snide comments about you.,5
I want a sketch from each of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.” The class surged forward around the trestle table.,5
"“And then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along — that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected.",5
” A streak of silver light flashed around the room.,5
"Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was rocking backward and forward on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation.",5
"“He’s just nervous,” said Harry.",5
“It’s through here — ” He glanced around at them all.,5
Mum.”  George looked around the table.,5
"Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong men for twelve months, and it is time you listened to sense!” “I — don’t — well — ” blustered Fudge, looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do.",5
The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air.,5
Snape ’s office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape ’s desk.,5
"They’ll be really pleased — I mean, prefect is something they can understand — ” “Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him.",5
All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered.,5
"“They are sort of nice, aren’t they?” she said, looking at it fondly.",5
"“Hey, Big D!” Dudley turned.",5
"ACCIO PROPHECY !” Harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst.",5
"“I had to stop you,” Harry gasped, picking up his bag.",5
They’ve always pulled the carriages.,5
"All first years to me!” A lantern came swinging toward Harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken over Hagrid ’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a while the previous year.",5
He’s going to — ’ Don’t you point that thing at me\” Dudley backed into the alley wall.,5
"After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville’s bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning.",5
"“Potter, that concludes our career consultation.” Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Umbridge.",5
“I’ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages!,5
"Hermione jumped up, looking flustered.",5
“Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago — ” “Who attacked you?” said Ron.,5
Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom.,5
"He felt shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he had always liked very much.",5
"“Did someone call?” “I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,” said Dumbledore.",5
"It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever.",5
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window.,5
"“And of course, they didn’t report a word about the dementors attacking you,” said Hermione.",5
"Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall?",5
"“Where’s — wand — come on — Lumosl” He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand — the wand tip had ignited.",5
"The first years lined up in front of the staff table facing the  rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back.",5
"Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart.",5
"We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.” “SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?” Harry yelled.",5
"“Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy...” “Let — let the others go, and I’ll give it to you!” said Harry desperately.",5
"“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,” said George.",5
"“It’s hidden in Hagrid’s hut, is it?” said Umbridge eagerly in Harry’s ear.",5
“Are you all right?” said Dumbledore.,5
"Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making.",5
Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap.,5
"Would he come straight back to his office afterward, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing?",5
"His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers.",5
"The Hog’s Head bar comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats.",5
I’ll take him from here...,5
He did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding.,5
"“I was gone the moment she looked back at me and I’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped log or something.” “But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk — ” Hermione began.",5
"“Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,” said Dumbledore.",5
"“Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats Hermione’s — she’s got me a homework planner — ” Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione’s handwriting on it.",5
"“Maybe Malfoy, he’d think it was a laugh.” They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left onto the road into the village, the wind whipping their hair into their eyes.",5
"“It’s these — ouch — shoes my brother gave me — ow — they’re eating my — OUCH — feet — look at them, there must be some kind of — AARGH — jinx on them and I can’t — AAAAARGH — get them off — ” He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals.",5
"“ ‘You’re too young, you’re not in the Order,’ ” said Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother’s.",5
"“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot.",5
"Well, if they were going to blame him for just seeing the attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time...  “Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius.",5
"“A branch of — ?” “Everlasting fire,” said Hermione irritably, “you ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class!” “Well anyway,” said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, “Dumbledore’d bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.’ ” “And what did Karkus say?” asked Harry eagerly.",5
"We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry- approved course of defensive magic this year.",5
"“Yes, I’d have to say you do, Dursley.” He turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry.",5
"His expression was calm, almost detached.",5
"He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass.",5
"Mrs. Weasley hesitated at the point of getting inside; Harry knew that her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of traveling without magic; finally the cold outside and her children’s pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the backseat between Fred and Bill with good grace.",5
"Harry left without another word, closing the door carefully behind him, his scar still throbbing painfully.",5
"“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food.",5
"I mean, he hasn’t got the Mark, for one thing.” “I don’t reckon he’d be stupid enough to turn up,” said Ron bracingly.",5
"You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way — ” “What use is that?” said Harry loudly.",5
The old woman’s screeches died and an echoing silence fell.,5
“What did you say?” Hagrid looked a little confused.,5
"“I can’t come into Hogsmeade at all, Angelina wants a full day’s training.",5
"“Or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy where we stick this,” said Fred.",5
"In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?” “ ’Course not, he’ll recover,” said Ron indifferently.",5
Today they suffered through three quarters of an hour’s droning on the subject of giant wars.,5
"Calm down... Blow your nose on this... It’s not as bad as you think, now... You are not going to have to leave Hogwarts...” “Oh really, Professor McGonagall?” said Umbridge in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward.",5
"Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry.",5
It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold — had he been that obvious?,5
He and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands.,5
"“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?” said Ron, watching her as though fearful for her sanity.",5
"He  looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why doesn’t Hagrid call again?” Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron’s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them.",5
"How you took the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play?",5
Tell Mummy!” Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his voice.,5
“Not — ?” “ Shhh\ ” whispered Hermione desperately.,5
Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees.,5
"“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn’t believe him.",5
"“I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W.",5
"“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily.",5
"He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose...” Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment.",5
"“All been talking about me, have you?",5
A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione’s.,5
"“Yeah, tha’s right,” said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak.",5
"“Bu’ — bu’ she got a bit tired of him after a while, I must admit ... so we split up on the journey home... She promised not ter tell anyone though...” “How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing?” said Harry.",5
“But in essence divided?” Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question.,5
"Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.",5
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather.,5
"“Not at all,” said Ginny.",5
"Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed.",5
"It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick.",5
"“Well, everyone had a good day?",5
"We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know — ” “ — some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order — ” said Hermione.",5
"Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark.",5
“And so we entered your second year at Hogwarts.,5
"They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snape’s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes’ conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country.",5
"Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is and how to get in there?” Their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology, where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof.",5
"Behind the door, a magnificent red-and-gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.",5
"Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd.",5
"“Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,” said the elf quietly.",5
"“But fairy eggs if they can get them.” “Good girl, take another five points.",5
“Mind you ... when he missed the fourteenth  He made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright doggy-paddle.,5
"“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia.",5
“What d’you reckon?” Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant.,5
"“No — Professor Dumbledore!” “Be quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,” said Dumbledore calmly.",5
"“It’s about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge’s first lesson, for what’s waiting out there.",5
"He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish.",5
"“Well ... see you later, then, Hagrid...” “I don’t believe him,” said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid.",5
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect...” The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.,5
"“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn.",5
"Keep out of it.” “I’m sure they’d never go over to You-Know-Who,” said Mr. Weasley, shaking his head.",5
"You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.” “Jolly good,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.",5
"He had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius... “Okay, write that down,” Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, “and then copy out this conclusion that I’ve written for you.” “Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever met,” said Ron weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again — ” “ — I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said Hermione.",5
At these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks.,5
‘Dreadful’?” Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll.,5
“Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore.,5
"Where is he anyway?” “I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly.",5
"“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply.",5
"“Harry, don’t do it, please don’t do it!” Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.",5
"Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes.",5
“Maybe someone came ter call earlier an’ I missed em.,5
"Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry!",5
"There was a loud, wailing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide.",5
"They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in their books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year.",5
"“I was pulling Neville up those benches in the — the room where the archway was, and I ripped his robes and it fell...” “The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries.",5
"Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake.",5
"“Just didn’t feel like it.” “No,” said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes.",5
“And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.” “How has that helped?” Harry asked.,5
"Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.” His cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry’s, who met his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream, willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand .",5
"“Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?” She looked up inquiringly, still smiling.",5
“How’re we going to get back out?” said Neville uncomfortably.,5
Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink.,5
"For the first time  ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.",5
"“Put your arm round my neck — ” Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville’s legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them.",5
"The Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the common room; people were watching its progress as though hypnotized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to catch it.",5
"“Look, I’m sorry,” cried Hermione, “but neither of you are making sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there — ” “Hermione, Harry’s seen them!” said Ron, rounding on her.",5
"“It — ” said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, “it was — just a dream I had.” “A dream,” repeated Snape.",5
"“Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody.",5
"“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news,” he said, beckoning Harry  forward as Percy’s heels disappeared up the stairs to the ninth level.",5
"“Expecto Patronurrd” A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain — concentrate — A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s robes, reaching for him.",5
"Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.",5
“But — why couldn’t you just grab a Portkey or something?” There was an odd expression in Hagrid’s unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying.,5
He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.,5
"So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.” “OUCH!” Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there.",5
"It’s so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s lying to destabilize him.” “You see the problem,” said Lupin.",5
“Isn’t it obvious?” she said.,5
"“SIRIUS!” There was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, the flashes of more spells.",5
"Turning to Hermione he said, “Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione?",5
"“And I don’t regret it either — I didn’t need the gold, and they’ll be great at a joke shop...” “But this is excellent!” said Ron, looking thrilled.",5
"“Well, I don’t fancy Healing,” said Ron on the last evening of the holidays.",5
"Now, Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me.",5
"Or on Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person.",5
"“It’s addressed to me, Vernon, look!",5
"“He’s just ...” But apparently he was unable to say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room.",5
"“This is Alastor Moody, Harry,” Lupin continued, pointing toward Moody.",5
"Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thought of leaving.",5
"“You see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor.” “You’ve found — ?” said Umbridge shrilly.",5
"Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon; Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.",5
"In fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts.",5
Professor Umbridge made another note.,5
"“Oh, it’s you, Harry,” said Hagrid.",5
"“Well done, Ron,” snapped Hermione.",5
"“ ‘You-Know- Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter, page nine ...’ Well,” said Hermione, folding up  the newspaper and throwing it aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about.",5
“I’ll plan his lessons for him if I have to.,5
"“How’d the exam go, Snivelly?” said James.",5
"She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late — the envelope burst into flames.",5
"In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.” He paused.",5
"“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start McGonagall’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch...” Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week... “I mean, we can do it tonight,” said Ron, as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, Hermione’s dire warnings that they would fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears.",5
"“Trivial hurts, tiny human accidents,” said Firenze, as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor.",5
"In case you haven’t noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story.",5
"level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L.” She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult.",5
"Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.",5
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly.,5
Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders.,5
"And now you’ve decided you’re not going to be there!” “I didn’t decide not to be there!” said Harry, stung by the injustice of these words.",5
“Haven’t got a clue.” They stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering.,5
"“Because he’s told the Minister of Magic  the truth and the Minister’s too much of an idiot to believe him.” “So you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named is back?” said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag.",5
"“Well,” said Hermione, “look on the bright side — at least now you’ll have time to do Snape’s essay!” “That’s a bright side, is it?” snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione.",5
"""... at the Solstice will come a new ...” said the figure of an old, bearded man.",5
"“So,” he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning immediately to Magorian.",5
"“My gran’s going do kill be,” said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, “dat was by dad’s old wand...” Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously.",5
A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone lurking out of sight snigger.,5
"Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.",5
"“Where do you think he — ?” But at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind them as the Fat Lady swung forward and Ron came clambering through the portrait hole.",5
"He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge.",5
"“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?” “No,” said Harry.",5
The fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight.,5
"“Tha’s good...” They had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn, looking around with every other step.",5
"“Yeah, you’re right,” said George, nodding, “this dosage looks strong enough, doesn’t it?” “I told you this morning, you can’t test your rubbish on students!” “We’re paying them!” said Fred indignantly.",5
"Fudge is behind it, I’ll bet anything.",5
"“Six months in Azkaban!” whispered Harry, shocked.",5
"“I’d NEVER call you a — you- know-what!” “Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you’ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down  corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can — I’m surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it.",5
"Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze.",5
"Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry’s relief they never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall,  looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger.",5
"And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t noticed, we’re on your side.” There was a short pause.",5
"Once he’d got his voice back, he’d explain what he’d been doing, wouldn’t he?",5
"“Righ’, now, who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?” Hermione raised her hand.",5
"Her eyes were large, round, and slightly bulging.",5
“Could’ve done with a bit more cloud cover.,5
“About what happened to him?,5
“That is a bit odd...” “So what’s in the Department of Mysteries?” Harry asked Ron.,5
"Several people said “Ouch!” as they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes, hastening to see what was going on below.",5
"Even the ominous sound of Snape’s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest.",5
"“ Expelliarmiousl I mean, Exnellimellius\ I — oh, sorry, Marietta!” Her curly-haired friend’s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault.",5
"“How’re you feeling?” Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them.",5
“F-fine ...” Harry could hardly believe this was real.,5
"“Sorry,” said Harry in a low voice.",5
It’s just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case!,5
"Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks.",5
They were all regarding him warily.,5
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said aggressively.,5
Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville’s parents and looked mortified.,5
"“Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it?” said Harry in a satisfied voice.",5
"Signed: Dolores Jane Umbridge HIGH INQUISITOR For some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure.",5
"The moment he realized this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly.",5
"“I’ve been checking every hour.” “You’ve been popping into the fire every hour?” Harry said, half laughing.",5
"Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique.",5
"We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be back soon.",5
“We’re all frozen to our brooms!,5
"“They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and I couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons...” Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters.",5
"Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness.",5
"The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along.",5
She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike.,5
"“Well, maybe Snape isn’t really trying to help Harry...” Harry and Hermione stared at him.",5
"“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later.",5
"“Oh no — sorry — ” “Here, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasley’s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building.",5
We only came in here because we hoped you’d drive her off for us — ”  Harry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur holding Hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this.,5
Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione’s chair.,5
"“Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?” “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes... That was something...” “And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!” “Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,” said Sirius, shrugging.",5
"“ ‘A lone voice of truth ... perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story .",5
"On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them, they permitted themselves a break from studying.",5
"But he was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that... “Why do I have to study Occlu — thing?” he blurted out.",5
"“Mundungus, of course,” said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed.",5
"He picked up his schoolbag, swung it over his shoulder, and hurried toward the office door.",5
"He could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.",5
"Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.” “What’s that supposed to be anyway?” asked Fred, squinting at Dobby’s painting.",5
"Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense.",5
"Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds.",5
Legilimens\” He was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letter box shut... A hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds toward him...,5
"“Anywhere here ... really close ...” “Harry?” said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond.",5
"“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing  everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed.",5
"“That’s no reason for them to take your things,” he said flatly.",5
"“He was the biggest, the ugliest, an’ the laziest.",5
This is more than a matter of school discipline...,5
"Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus.",5
"“Well,” said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly.",5
"The Fat Friar told me ...” He dropped his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to lean closer to him to hear, ""... that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they’d searched the castle and grounds for him.",5
"“But unfortunately,” she said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as though she had lockjaw, “it is what I think that counts, as they are in my House, Dolores.” “Well, actually, Minerva,” simpered Umbridge, “I think you’ll find that what I think does count.",5
Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one.,5
"“I’ve been meaning to ask you for ages... Did Cedric — did he m-m-mention me at all before he died?” This was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho.",5
"Next thing he knew, something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee.",5
"“You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stinkpellets if you’d known I had it in my power to whip you raw, would you, now?",5
"“Thanks, Dobby!” said Harry, stroking Hedwig’s head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream...",5
Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice.,5
"“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.” The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy- looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor.",5
"“The only people who can see thestrals,” she said, “are people who have seen death.”  “Tha’s exactly right,” said Hagrid solemnly, “ten points ter Gryffindor.",5
Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top.,5
Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others.,5
He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak.,5
"“Well, Minerva,” said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirtsleeve, “I’m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore.” “You think so, do you?” said Professor McGonagall scornfully.",5
"Panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face him.",5
"“If you want that on your conscience, Hermione ...” “Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped.",5
Fang was barking madly at the door.,5
He knew Moody was still watching him.,5
"One, of course, was you.",5
“I’m in detention!” Harry yelled after her as she stalked away.,5
I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s office.,5
"Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione.",5
"A few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup.",5
None of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors.,5
"“He hasn’t been out of Grimmauld Place for years.” “Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,” said Dumbledore, “when Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’ He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house.",5
"“Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.” “I want to know where Sirius is!” “I want to know where Sirius is!” mimicked the woman to his left.",5
“Feel all right?” said George kindly to a small dark- haired girl lying at his feet.,5
“WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR?,5
"“Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?” “Very good, Potter, very good ...” said Malfoy slowly.",5
A dull pounding pain was developing over his  right eye.,5
"“No,” said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could.",5
"“Cruciol” Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground.",5
It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk- white and covered in blood.,5
He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure and looked around at the others.,5
"Anyway, we can’ let ourselves be pushed around by that lot...” “Nice try,” Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen.",5
"Dementors here, in Little Whinging .",5
"“Hi,” said Cho slightly breathlessly.",5
"“Duplicate your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once.",5
"He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so  that they rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.",5
"He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a lot of money, I mean — ” “ What?” said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat.",5
"As he reached the pavement, Harry looked around.",5
"That’s great news, really great...” “Yes, isn’t it?” said Mrs. Weasley, leading her husband forward into a chair.",5
"“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,” said Umbridge sweetly.",5
"If any of them knew, if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to ... Mrs. Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he thought savagely.",5
"Voldemort’s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought desperately.",5
"“We jus’ had ter be careful, ’cause Olympe an’ me, we stick out a bit — ” Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea.",5
Lupin had pulled out a book and was reading.,5
Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green and clammy looking.,5
You may go.” He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could.,5
"“The meeting’s over, Dung,” said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the table.",5
"“So ... like I was saying ... if you want to learn some defense, then we need to work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet, and where we’re going to — ” “Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?” There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.",5
"“Yes, that’s what made me think maybe it wasn’t a good idea after all...”  Peeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed.",5
"“Morning,” Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, joining them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.",5
"They moved back into position with the desk between them, Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time... “On the count of three, then,” said Snape, raising his wand once more.",5
"I fancied a walk,” said Ron shiftily.",5
"The figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was gone.",5
"“We know what you are keeping in the forest, Hagrid!” Magorian called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight.",5
"Well, I think that’s all, Potter ... unless ...” He leaned forward a little.",5
"Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak.",5
"“I’m — sorry,” she said thickly.",5
"“I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?” said Hermione wearily.",5
"He did not want to intrude upon the Weasleys’ happiness, and he dreaded the moment when Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision.",5
Bode would have known he could not...,5
"“Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny — ” “No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors ... describe them.” “Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now.",5
I am saying this for the last time...,5
"“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin fading.",5
"He took deep breaths, willing himself not to vomit all over Ron.",5
"“Well, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,” Professor McGonagall continued briskly.",5
"Meanwhile, Ginny’s equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by Luna’s blonde one.",5
"His heart drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.",5
"“He’s never going to notice us,” he whispered.",5
“I didn’t realize that would happen.,5
"Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry, “Collo — aaaaaaaaargh ??",5
"The kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr. Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas covered by a mackintosh.",5
"“I was having a dream at first about something completely different, something stupid .",5
"“Are you serious, Harry?” said Lupin quickly.",5
"“Whozair?” said Harry, sitting upright in his chair.",5
"His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt.",5
"Cho had just got up; still not looking  at him, she left the Great Hall.",5
"“Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark — ” “Harry, we saw Uranus up close!” said Ron, still giggling feebly.",5
“Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.,5
"“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said George happily.",5
"And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.",5
"The garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and empty as last time.",5
His insides were pulsing with rage.,5
"No cure at all.” “A werewolf?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed.",5
"Hagrid’s fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily onto his chest.",5
"Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry’s head as he launched himself toward Neville — “Can you stand?” he bellowed in Neville’s ear, as Neville’s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably.",5
"“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our — ” “I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly.",5
"“Grimmauld Place?” “Oh no,” said Dumbledore with a grim smile.",5
"It helps with the stingin’, yeh know.” “So are you going to tell us what’s happened to you?” Harry asked.",5
"“And if we can’t trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone.” With so much to worry about and so much to do — startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working until past midnight, secret D.A.",5
"“Come with me,” Harry said quickly.",5
"There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped.",5
"So save your breath, Hermione.” “I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George!” she said in an injured voice.",5
"Neighborhood children all around were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of “that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.",5
"The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the street-lamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.",5
"“He seemed to think it was best,” said Hermione rather breathlessly.",5
"He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying toward lunch.",5
"“Oh, forget it, then,” muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him.",5
He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first.,5
"“Jus’ fer stoppin’ all of yeh committin’ murder?” “You ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,” said Magorian.",5
"“May I help, Professor McGonagall?” asked Professor Umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice.",5
Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in?,5
When he saw Harry and Hermione he stopped dead in his tracks.,5
Luna turned her pale eyes upon him instead.,5
"“Look at this!” “I’ve got all the robes I want,” said Ron.",5
He was running along a windowless passage with Mr. Weasley...,5
He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back: Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts.,5
"“Fine, fine,” said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing.",5
"The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione ’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.",5
Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp’s blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees.,5
He did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had started the D.A.,5
Er — now?” He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed.,5
"“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs.",5
“She doesn’t really want to be here but I made her come with me.,5
"“What — I don’t — ?” “Dumbledore’s Army, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge’s face.",5
Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry’s direction.,5
"“By yourself?” “ ’Course I did, couldn’t stand by an’ watch ’em kill him, could I?” said Hagrid.",5
“Have you ...” he began.,5
"They haven’t stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect.” “I wish I was going to be there,” said Harry bitterly, as they set off together toward the common room.",5
"But before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.",5
"Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year.",5
"“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley’s continual references to the map; but a second later he said, “Ah yes ... this way, Harry,” and led him down a side road.",5
"The silvery lights shivered on the wall... Harry took two steps toward the desk, thinking hard.",5
“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.,5
"and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet...",5
"Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first years.",5
"“Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks ...” Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.",5
"She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold when she wished them Merry Christmas, and they all averted their eyes.",5
"“Oh my goodness,” said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless.",5
"“You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours.",5
"Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted Tonks and Mad- Eye, who had turned up to escort them across London, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the underground.",5
"“It wasn’t a very fast Snitch and Summerby’s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment.",5
"“You said it was row ninety-seven,” whispered Hermione.",5
"But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss.",5
"“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on the arm.",5
"“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply.",5
"“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, he’s our financial backer.” “Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand to Harry.",5
"“ You sent the dementors after me?” “ Somebody had to act,” breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harry’s forehead.",5
"“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?” “At least it’s only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back onto his bench and looked down at his steak-and-kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much.",5
"Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron, and Hermione ’s whispered discussion about how  Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.",5
"“Another zero, then, Potter Harry was too incensed to speak.",5
I’m going to be behind you.,5
"“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have meant you at all.",5
"“Why was Dung hiding from us?” asked Ron, sounding disappointed.",5
"Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken-and-ham pie on Dean’s other side, but Harry knew he was listening.",5
"Harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes... “How much further?” demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him.",5
"“It was like something rose up inside me, like there’s a snake inside me — ” “You need to sleep,” said Sirius firmly.",5
"“He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails them.",5
“This is no cowardly flight — you are being noble.”  Harry ignored him.,5
"“He’s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his watch.",5
"“But ...” Looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, “He — he can’t be near us now, can he?” “No,” Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing his forehead.",5
"“Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.” “It’s Harry!” said George, pointing at the back of the picture.",5
"Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way...” It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department.",5
"“Oh ... hi,” she said breathlessly.",5
"“Ready to tell the public the truth?” “I suppose,” said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.",5
"Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned around.",5
He heard one of the girls shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body.,5
"“Hello,” said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice.",5
"This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip.",5
“I mean ... you know ...” She looked carefully around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table.,5
"I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you.",5
"“Merlin’s beard, keep it down!” said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads.",5
Rain was lashing the high windows.,5
"“Over here, Professor ...” Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose.",5
"“Of course you can... Well, I’d better get going if I’ve got a broom to buy too.",5
"She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, she’s an evil, twisted, mad, old — “Ron?” He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his broomstick.",5
"She had straggly, waist-length, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look.",5
"“Mountains?” Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast.",5
He got to his feet.,5
"Is it that snake?” “No — everyone’s fine — ” gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it was on fire again.",5
"“Oh well,” said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, “you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her...” “What if he doesn’t want to ask her?” said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face.",5
"Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.",5
"“Let her sleep,” said George hastily.",5
WE NEED THE PROPHECY!” “He dared — he dares — ” shrieked Bellatrix incoherently.,5
"So — everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?” Everybody put up their hands, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very halfheartedly.",5
"They crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing — then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris.",5
"You-Know- Who’s only been back two months, and we’ve started fighting among ourselves.",5
"“Erm,” said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid.",5
"A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.",5
"When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him.",5
"First Floor (Bites, stings, burns, embedded spines, etc.)",5
He opened his mouth even wider.,5
“Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad?,5
I’ve b-been here sixteen years!,5
"Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer’s night, mark you.",5
Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face.,5
"Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so.",5
"“Yeah, it was jus’ the pair of us.",5
"“Yeah, well,” said Harry wearily, moving toward the door, “I dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it’s nothing to be proud of.” “Oh don’t go!” said Cho, sounding tearful again.",5
"He messed it up.” “Or rather, you messed it up for him,” said Lupin with a satisfied smile.",5
"His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him with a look of gloating pleasure.",5
"“Er ... no, I don’t think I will, thanks,” he said.",5
"Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away.",5
"Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke.",5
Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.,5
"“I mean, obviously it’s some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it’s rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object... I’d imagine the charm wouldn’t have a very long life though...” Harry did not answer; he was still feeling ill. “I’m going to have to do this tomorrow,” he muttered, pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it.",5
"The scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over their heads, and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.",5
"But before he could make a decision about what to do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.",5
“And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore’s office?” demanded Terry Boot.,5
"And what’s more, someone’s put another niffler in Umbridge’s office, I don’t know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off — by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg — ” “Good,” said Harry and Ron together.",5
"In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him.",5
"“You’ve got exams coming!” “Told you already, we’re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s,” said Fred.",5
Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster.,5
"The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.",5
"The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely.",5
"He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione.",5
They’re going to be slaughtered.,5
"“Hang on,” said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them.",5
But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young ... and I seem to have forgotten lately...” The sun was rising properly now.,5
Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention.,5
"“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody.",5
"“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come.",5
"“Blimey, Mum won’t like that...” He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening intently.",5
"“You need to mean them, Potter!",5
"Snape looked around at him, his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair.",5
"And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.” “I don’t understand what you’re saying,” said Harry.",5
Are you feeling sick?” They were all watching him.,5
"“Not pomegranate juice!” “Right,” said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner.",5
"“Getting mail?” “Be careful, Mr. Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention,” said Umbridge.",5
They were in the hospital wing.,5
They didn’t fight Quirrell with me.,5
"“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation.",5
No one took any notice.,5
They left the Owlery together.,5
"Some people call me ‘Loony’ Lovegood, actually.”  Harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully.",5
"“Er,” said Harry, without moving.",5
"Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus’s head, and thrust the final one into Neville’s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf.",5
His heart was thumping very hard and fast.,5
"Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-green jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood’s magazine.",5
"Now staring at her own hands she said, “Do you honestly trust his judgment?” “Yes, I do!” said Harry at once.",5
"Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione’s delight, missed all her lessons the following day, as she had sprouted antlers.",5
"“A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,” said Lupin, as though he had read Harry’s mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly.",5
"“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,” said Hermione.",5
"“It happens, young man, it happens!",5
"He had to punish himself afterward, but he still managed it.” Sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, “I’ll look for him later, I expect I’ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother’s old bloomers or something... Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died...",5
His mouth was very dry.,5
"They were long- fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders against the dark velvet of the chair.",5
"So don’t harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.” “What d’you mean, who’s taking anything badly?",5
"meetings, haven’t we?” “You know what I mean,” said Hermione impatiently.",5
"Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.",5
"“I — well — well, okay, I’ll tell you, but don’t laugh, all right?” Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second.",5
"Yes.” He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read, “The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C  of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy.",5
"Everywhere Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not been seen since the end of the match.",5
"“But it won’t be long now...” “Hey, Harry,” said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor.",5
"I haven’t been out all week, have you?” “No,” said Harry.",5
"“Name it, Harry Potter, sir!” “I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers.",5
"But we managed ter give the berk tailin’ us the slip round abou’ Dee-John — ” “Ooooh, Dijon?” said Hermione excitedly.",5
But they’ve bin dyin’ out fer ages.,5
"As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in studying under the beech tree on the edge of the lake, where they stood less chance of being overheard than in the common room.",5
"“Couple of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an’ he wasn’ dangling them upside down.” “How d’you know they were Death Eaters?” said Ron.",5
"“If she catches yeh, it’ll be all of our necks on the line,” he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job further, they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings.",5
"Ron sniggered, breaking off when Hermione caught his eye.",5
"“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, “yes ...” He flicked through it.",5
"This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the center of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet below them.",5
Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance.,5
I’m not going to harp on about anything ...” Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street.,5
"“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed Dumbledore?” Harry asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing.",5
"While ev’ryone’s watchin’ the match?” “Er ... can’t it wait, Hagrid?” asked Harry.",5
"He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity ...",5
"“I think a few of mine have ruptured,” said Fred in a hollow voice.",5
“Come here...” She pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them onto the backs of their mounts.,5
"“Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,” said Hermione at once.",5
"Like Hagrid, he was armed: A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over his shoulders.",5
"“Well, he mustn’t do it again, that’s all.",5
Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously.,5
"Ron, I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can’t believe how fast you’re growing ... what color would you like?” “Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said George, smirking.",5
"“Completely lousy,” said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione.",5
"Well, he doesn’t tell me anything anymore...” “I’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,” said Sirius steadily.",5
"Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would.",5
"“Yes?” “Nothing,” said Harry quietly.",5
"They’re disappearing like mad!”  And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up.",5
"He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged... Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius’s house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry himself?",5
"“We do not help humans!” snarled the centaur holding Harry, tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry’s feet left the ground momentarily.",5
"Angelina, however, said quickly, “The Quidditch season’s about to start, we need team practices too!” “Let’s say next Wednesday night, then,” said Harry, “and we can decide on additional meetings then... Come on, we’d better get going...” He pulled out the Marauder’s Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor.",5
"“An’ he’s gettin’ better, he’s not fightin’ so much anymore — ” “So this is why it took you two months to get home!” said Hermione distractedly.",5
"“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile.",5
Lupin’ll be covering you from below.,5
The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away.,5
"What about you, Hermione?” “I don’t know,” said Hermione.",5
"“I’ll join, I want to join, I want to fight — ” “No.” It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.",5
"She sold us all out, including you!” “Well ... we all got away, didn’t we?” said Cho pleadingly.",5
"But I mustn’t get my hopes up...” Fred, George, and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.",5
"“How was practice?” asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.",5
"Left alone in the dark room, Harry turned toward the wall.",5
"“Potter has a criminal record,” said Umbridge loudly.",5
"Then you’d both be outcasts together.”  “Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged.",5
"He might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday.",5
"For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.” “It’s not my own neck I’m saving,” said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.",5
"There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes.",5
"“It’s Professor Umbridge, sir — she needs your help,” said Malfoy.",5
"“It looks wonderful, Molly,” said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate for her and handing it across the table.",5
"“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.",5
Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation?,5
"Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don’t be shy, let’s hear what you’ve got to — galloping gargoyles!” As Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire.",5
“Why can’t Dumbledore teach Harry?” asked Sirius aggressively.,5
"“Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you,” said Ginny simply.",5
"“Rookwood used to work there... Maybe Voldemort’ll send Rookwood to do it?”  Hermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought.",5
"“Potter, you cannot win against me!” she cried.",5
"“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame.",5
Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbor’s paper.,5
"Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star chart he or she had been given.",5
"“Don’t think we were followed...” Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and Hermione.",5
The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them.,5
"“I never knew that!” “Mum told Ron not to spread it around,” said Fred, grinning at Harry.",5
"Somewhat to Harry’s disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog’s Head.",5
"“You are forcing me, Potter...",5
"For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses.",5
"“Well, 111 have a think and get back to — ” He broke off.",5
"“I’m already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?” “Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever!” said Professor McGonagall tartly.",5
The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened.,5
"“Either way, he’s still got four legs,” said Hermione coolly.",5
"Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hippogriff’s room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed Buckbeak dead rats.",5
I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind...,5
"some grave peril ...” Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised.",5
"He climbed the remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened the drawing-room door.",5
"“We just haven’t got your brains or your memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are — is it nice to rub it in?” “Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.",5
"He could visualize a heading, in Hermione’s handwriting: The Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards.",5
Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers.,5
"“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly.",5
"“Six o’clock Monday evening, Potter.” He was gone.",5
"“Fer the las’ time, it’s nuthin’!” said Hagrid firmly.",5
The screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall; they grew louder as Harry ran toward the stone steps leading up from the dungeons.,5
"year, you wait, they’re somethin’ really special.” “Erm .",5
There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling.,5
"“No, you go on,” he heard her say to her friend Marietta, and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam’s apple.",5
"At the same time, the words had appeared on the back of Harry’s right hand, cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as he stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.",5
There was a long and painful silence.,5
"“You’ve got to tell someone,” said Ron.",5
"“Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it.",5
"“She says you need to talk to Sirius?” “What?” said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway toward picking up MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES.",5
Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry.,5
“The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere.,5
"Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.” He turned to leave, his black traveling cloak billowing behind him.",5
"“Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?” “No,” said Sirius, glancing behind him.",5
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase.,5
Only Harry and Hermione were left beside the fire.,5
"“And what,” she said in a whisper that nevertheless carried all around the entrance hall, “are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings?” “Oh, that won’t be a problem,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.",5
"After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again.",5
“The headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency.,5
"“The headmistress would like to see you, Potter,” he leered.",5
"“I thought this evening we should just go over the things we’ve  done so far, because it’s the last meeting before the holidays and there’s no point starting anything new right before a three-week break — ” “We’re not doing anything new?” said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room.",5
"On Harry’s right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.",5
"He walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking... Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore.",5
"“We might have put a toe across it occasionally,” said George.",5
It sounded to Harry too as though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death.,5
Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness.,5
He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.,5
"“In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.” Harry’s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer.",5
A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face.,5
"“We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,” she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly.",5
"“Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?” said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.",5
"He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, “It must have been ... tough ... talking about it... Was it?” “Yeah,” mumbled Harry, “but people have got to know what Voldemort’s capable of, haven’t they?” “That’s right,” said Neville, nodding, “and his Death Eaters too ... People should know...” Neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato.",5
"But it was definitely something hairy, Harry!” Hermione’s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around her.",5
"“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor McGonagall grimly, “without serious application, practice, and study.",5
"“Insubordination, sir!” roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his fists.",5
"“And your name is — ?” “Hermione Granger,” said Hermione.",5
So how could it have gone so wrong?,5
"While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, he’s going to go cautiously for a while.",5
She coaxed it down onto her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel.,5
Dumbledore was now  stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger.,5
"So anyway,” he checked his watch, “phase one is about to begin.",5
So — is it really true?,5
"“It’s us, Neville!” said Ron brightly, getting to his feet.",5
"We haven’t wanted to open it just in case it’s something really nasty.” “No problem, Molly ...” Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen.",5
"Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his gaze.",5
"Then Harry’s foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody’s magic eye spinning away across the floor.",5
All four of them had been gagged.,5
"Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs ...” Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing.",5
The  doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes.,5
Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter.,5
And then he found someone’s toes and pressed down upon them.,5
"What else did he say?” “Nothing whatsoever,” said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.",5
"We get career advice too, later this year, Bill told me.",5
"He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again, and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder.",5
"The moment they reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before.",5
"“Yeah, it was!” said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them.",5
Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other too.,5
"“We didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?” “What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry.",5
"Looking up he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people below.",5
"“Wait, there’s more,” said Hermione grimly.",5
"“How come all the spells bounced off him?” “It’ll be his giant blood,” said Hermione shakily.",5
"Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.",5
A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley’s whisper  and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into Harry’s mind.,5
The prophecy was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out.,5
“But — ” “She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention.,5
"Oh, one of these days ...” She took a deep shuddering breath.",5
"Jus’ maybe, them that don’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains, an’ there’s gotta be a chance they’ll remember Dumbledore’s friendly to ’em... Could be they’ll come ...” Snow was filling up the window now.",5
"Fred, George, and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in their night things.",5
Grawp ’s lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly.,5
"He knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance — He was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature’s began.",5
Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.,5
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione glanced at one another, but didn’t know what to say.",5
"A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of a wild boar’s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it.",5
"“These will be good when we’re practicing Stunning,” said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.",5
"“And you two are clearly Weasleys,” Mrs. Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn.",5
"Rita had pressed him for every little detail, and he had given her everything he could remember, knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth.",5
"“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the wheels below them creaked into motion.",5
"“Anyway,” he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, “since then the other centaurs Ve bin livid with me an’ the trouble is, they’ve got a lot of influence in the forest... Cleverest creatures in here “Is that why we’re here, Hagrid?” asked Hermione.",5
"When the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not expected at all.",5
?” He read the answer in the elf’s stricken face.,5
“Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet.” “But what if you’d been seen?” said Hermione anxiously.,5
A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night.,5
"“Good thinking,” said Luna very seriously.",5
Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.,5
The Slytherin team were standing waiting for them.,5
"“ — got — er — me,” Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say.",5
"“I thought he was working in Egypt.” “He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,” said Fred.",5
"They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air wafted over them as they played a desultory game of wizard chess.",5
"“Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack).” cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.",5
"“She shouldn’t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.” “Er — right — thanks,” said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.",5
"But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred’s parting words deeply to heart.",5
"An awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table.",5
"Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it out, and began to read.",5
He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech.,5
"“Look,” he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, “let’s not talk about Cedric right now... Let’s talk about something else...” But this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.",5
"She hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, “Well, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me.",5
"Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him.",5
"“Ah, yes,” said his grandmother, looking closely at Harry and sticking out a shriveled, clawlike hand for him to shake.",5
“I want three-hundred- and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.” “How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry asked.,5
The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry’s fingers but he had managed to cling to it.,5
"“What happened?” But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle.",5
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment.,5
“It must be somebody your end ...” Harry’s heart skipped several beats.,5
"He knew that Seamus’s mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come over so Dursley-ish.",5
"An’ gives them time ter test out the firs’ present an’ find out it’s a good one, an’ get ’em eager fer more.",5
"“A loud chorus of Weasley Is Our King’ if they see Umbridge coming,” replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in the crack between door and wall.",5
"I’ve done more than either of them\ But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t choose prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations... Maybe he chooses them for other reasons... Ron must have something you don’t... Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.",5
"He and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station toward the place where the Dursleys stood, apparently rooted to the floor.",5
"The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.",5
"“You haven’t been given another detention!” she said at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly.",5
He would do better to abandon it.,5
"“You have done well to tell me this,” said Harry.",5
Didn’t I tell you I’d booked the Quidditch pitch specially?,5
"“Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,” said Mr. Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all.",5
"“Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,” said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, “in imitation of my natural habitat.",5
Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window.,5
"Dragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went.",5
"The examination is nearly over, but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely?” “Yes,” said Harry wildly.",5
"“Wasn’ room ter swing a kneazle,” said Hagrid.",5
"“Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one side, that’s how you let in the last three goals!” “Sorry ...” Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky.",5
"Harry’s detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.",5
"“Thank you,” said Dumbledore softly.",5
"“Okay everyone,” said Angelina, entering from the Captain’s office, already changed.",5
The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he’d experienced it.,5
Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar.,5
"“It’s Tonks.” “ — Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only,” finished Lupin.",5
“He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice.,5
"“Crabbe and Goyle would’ve torn you apart.” Neville said nothing, he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.",5
"Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire... Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk, and started to dress.",5
"Even by Harry’s low standards in Divination, the exam went very badly.",5
"“They’ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know, trying to persuade him he’ll be able to lead an almost normal life.",5
"“And don’t forget, all of you — careful what you put in writing.",5
"ME!” Ron was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge of tears.",5
"The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took seats on either side of Ginny.",5
He noticed that her hands too bore the marks of Hedwig’s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.,5
"“Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,” said Ron at once.",5
"He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape’s desk with filled and corked flagons.",5
"It’s not fair!” he added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly.",5
"If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself.” “Kill him, more like,” said Fred firmly.",5
"“I’ve had worse.” The elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes.",5
"Both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground.",5
"“They’ll come back, they always do in the end.",5
Birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away.,5
"“It ... it was a very good business opportunity, see ...” Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.",5
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs.,5
"“Petrificus Totalusl” shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand.",5
I am going to walk” — she mimed walking — Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter — “among the students” — she pointed around at individual members of the class — “and ask them questions.” She pointed at her mouth to indicate talking.,5
"Dumbledore’s spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line — Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival.",5
Harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package.,5
"I want to talk to you.”  “What are you doing here?” Harry asked her, pulling open the door, as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he might have dropped.",5
"“You see, Dumbledore?” said Phineas Nigellus slyly.",5
“No real use?” said Ron in a strained voice.,5
"“I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before?” said Hermione, sounding slightly anxious.",5
He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing- white parchment.,5
"“Boys,” Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, “your mother’s right, you’re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you’ve come of age — ” “ — none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!” Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again.",5
Why did I not tell you everything?,5
"“I ’ppreciate this, you two, I really do,” said Hagrid as they reached the stairs.",5
He cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dumbledore — the very thought of him made Harry’s insides burn with anger again.,5
Last night he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor.,5
"“Oh yes,” she said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise.",5
"“I — what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan.",5
"“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth.",5
"“You — !” But before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head.",5
Was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead?,5
"“He’s only fifteen and — ” “ — and he’s dealt with as much as most in the Order,” said Sirius, “and more than some — ” “No one’s denying what he’s done!” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair.",5
"Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.",5
"Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he’s always popping in and out of the Ministry...  It’ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, wont it?” “Don’t rise,” Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched.",5
Harry and Cho looked at each other.,5
"“It’s proving tricky, though.” “Why?” “Because of the Ministry’s attitude,” said Tonks.",5
"Nearly failed on Stealth and  Tracking, I’m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs?” “Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.",5
“Pay attention.” It would have been hard to say whether Ron’s face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height.,5
Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.,5
"“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him,” said George to Fred.",5
"“Because I recognized one of ’em,” Hagrid growled.",5
He was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walked away across the lawn.,5
"Henceforth, stay away from this place.",5
"“I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team?” “I s’pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite.",5
"“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left.",5
“And they’re off!” said Lee.,5
"“Oh yes he will, Minerva!” said Dumbledore sharply.",5
"“McGonagall would go nuts if she knew — ” “Yeah, she probably would,” said Harry.",5
"“Well, it’s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,” said Hermione impatiently, “and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T.",5
"“Yes, Molly dear,” said Mr. Weasley meekly.",5
"You’re not staying here if some loony’s after you, you’re not endangering my wife and son, you’re not bringing trouble down on us, if you’re going the same way as your useless parents, I’ve had it!",5
"He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though; he had not talked to him properly since he had returned... Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led  down to the Slytherin common room.",5
"Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so he could watch Harry play.",5
"Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help.",5
"The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station they found it already full of early morning commuters.",5
The castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday.,5
"And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little, if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.”  He closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope.",5
“How was it?” Harry considered for a moment.,5
"“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?” But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.",5
"“No,” said Harry, “I haven’t seen anyone.” “See, I wouldn’t ’ave left,” said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, “but I ’ad a business opportunity — ” Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione’s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry’s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius’s lap and curled up.",5
"He had more important things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.",5
"“So you’re going to descend to his level?” “No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets mine.” “For heaven’s sake, Ron — ”  “I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates writing,” said Ron happily.",5
"“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently.",5
The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue.,5
"I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn’t to have ... Well, that is neither here nor there...",5
"Tell Ron for me, will you?” “Oh no,” said Hermione, looking relieved, “if you’re going that means I can go without being rude too, I’m absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow.",5
"Unfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney.",5
“I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young — ”  “They’re not his!” interrupted Bane contemptuously.,5
"“Oh Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors!",5
"He was in the bed opposite Lockhart’s, just lying there, staring at the ceiling.",5
"The people in Hagrid’s row were not complaining, merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible.",5
"Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, “I’ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don’t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won’t you?” Snape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play.",5
"“I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time.",5
"“They’re tree- guardians, usually live in wand-trees.” “Five points for Gryffindor,” said Professor Grubbly- Plank.",5
The door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.,5
"“Okay,” she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace.",5
"He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm.",5
Harry was deluged in the foul- smelling potion within.,5
“I’ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that.,5
Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him?,5
He seemed not to have felt it.,5
The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first.,5
"“Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both owls and they’re thrilled,” she added, beaming.",5
"“Yes, it was quite enjoyable, you know.",5
"“Excellent,” whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats.",5
"He was sure that all the portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been and why there had been injuries.",5
He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.,5
He could just imagine Professor McGonagall’s reaction if he were caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge’s office mere hours after she had vouched for him.,5
"“You’re dead, aren’t you?” said Harry exasperatedly.",5
"He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic.” “But Dumbledore doesn’t want — ” “Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley.",5
"You know perfectly well that your lot ...” “Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, ""... that your lot don’t get on our news!” “That’s all you know,” said Harry.",5
"Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.",5
"It appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire.",5
I will kill him!” “But — ” The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway.,5
"“No, it was only ... Well, I just wanted to say ... Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell...” “Yeah, well,” said Harry moodily.",5
"At least you’re not covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself.",5
"“ ‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said Madam Marchbanks.",5
"“I mean, come on ... We’ve got exams and we’re about that far,” he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a millimeter apart, “from being chucked out as it is.",5
"It hurt because ... he’s ... angry.” Harry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them — yet he knew at once that they were true.",5
"For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have the power to turn off the stars.",5
"“D’you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you’d be able to see the Quaffle better?” He, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of “Weasley Is Our King.” Ron’s ears turned scarlet.",5
"Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.",5
"He would be risking expulsion again... Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.",5
"“So,” said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry’s wand, “had any ideas?” “How did you get away?” asked Harry in amazement, taking his wand from Ron.",5
"“There’s nothing you can do, Harry — ” “Get him, save him, he’s only just gone through!” “It’s too late, Harry — ” “We can still reach him — ” Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go... “There’s nothing you can do, Harry ... nothing... He’s gone.”  “He hasn’t gone!” Harry yelled.",5
Dobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hats.,5
He rolled over onto his back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase.,5
He had not really said very much.,5
"He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the room, holding open the door for Snape.",5
"“This way,” said Mr. Weasley.",5
Harry looked round at his godfather.,5
"“ That one.” he poked a thick finger at Neville, “tried to stop me taking her,” he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her, “so I brought him along too.”  “Good, good,” said Umbridge, watching Ginny’s struggles.",5
Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed.,5
He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren; the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells.,5
"“I’m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Sorcerer’s Stone,” she said fiercely, “and it’s because of me Malfoy’s stuck back in Umbridge’s office with giant flying bogeys attacking him — ” “Yeah, but — ” “We were all in the D.A.",5
"A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby.",5
"“You want Spell Damage, fourth floor.",5
"There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers.",5
"“When you’re ready,” she said, “we’re going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.” “We’ll be there in a bit,” Harry assured her.",5
He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him.,5
"Let’s get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.” “But what’s a portrait of your mother doing here?” Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.",5
"“She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.",5
"He gave his thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door.",5
"Now, thestrals — ” “Hem, hem.” Professor Umbridge had arrived.",5
“Calm down!” she said feverishly.,5
"“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” Harry muttered, “but it was only the first training session, like you said...” Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night.",5
"The final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May.",5
"“George, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we’ll be seeing you all later.” In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too.",5
Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry.,5
And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced.,5
"“Up you get, Sibyll...”  Professor Sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney’s other arm.",5
"Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?”  “Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day.",5
"“Thanks,” said George, looking both surprised and pleased.",5
"“You see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally.",5
"Dobby has used it, sir,” said the elf, dropping his voice and looking guilty, “when Winky has been very drunk.",5
Harry looked at him curiously.,5
"“I was slashed by a hippogriff.” “A hippogriff?” said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically.",5
"“See you, then ...” The six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging their trunks.",5
You will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one.,5
“So I can do whatever I like.,5
"“Look, here come more now... You two must really smell...” Harry turned.",5
"“It was that thug, Crabbe,” said Angelina angrily.",5
"“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly.",5
Snape’s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class’s silence.,5
"“Not at all well,” said Harry firmly, getting to his feet while concealing Hedwig behind his back.",5
“One: He’s sitting on my  chair.,5
"Anyway, one o’ them had a bit of English an’ ’e translated fer the others, an’ what we had ter say didn’ seem ter go down too badly.",5
"“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly.",5
"“Get over here,” muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry’s wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column.",5
"“Look, you three” — he pointed at Neville, Ginny, and Luna — “you’re not involved in this, you’re not — ” They burst into more protests.",5
"Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.",5
"“You want us to teach him,” Harry said in a hollow voice.",5
"“Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall ... and ... ah.” Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of  candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him.",5
A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming.,5
"You reckon I want to act the hero again?” “No, no, no!” said Hermione, looking aghast.",5
They were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor.,5
"“Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly.",5
He sank onto the bed opposite the others.,5
"“Get away from here, giant!” called Magorian.",5
“Coming?” he said awkwardly to Harry.,5
His face felt hot; he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it.,5
"“Funnily enough, it does,” said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice.",5
Newspaper  cuttings and old photographs — even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding — papered the walls.,5
"“Yes, well,” said Hermione hastily, “moving on ... the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?” There was a murmur of general agreement.",5
Times of individual appointments are listed below.,5
"That’s a Howler.” “Let go of it, Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon.",5
"But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort.",5
"Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins.",5
"Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway.",5
"“Now, what are you up to?” “Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated.",5
“I still don’t understand.” “Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth.,5
“Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother.,5
"I am sending you back to Sirius’s house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than the Burrow.",5
"If Dumbledore — ”  “Ah, well, you’ve put your finger on the problem,” said Mr. Weasley with a wry smile.",5
"The attemp’s cornin’ on fine.” “Hagrid, what’re you up to?” asked Harry seriously.",5
He turned his back on it.,5
"“For the last time, Mundungus,” called Mrs. Weasley, “will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we’re about to eat!” “Ah,” said Mundungus.",5
"“And if you want dinner before midnight I’ll need a hand,” Mrs. Weasley said to the room at large.",5
"He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he placed carefully upon his desk.",5
"“I’ve told you,” Harry muttered.",5
"He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least...",5
“And they are not so young...,5
"“Well, I’b going do find dem wid you,” said Neville firmly.",5
"“Oh — well — I suppose ...” “So that’s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and Miss Granger,” said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor’s hourglass as she spoke.",5
She had abandoned her baby voice now.,5
"“It’s — ” said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, “it’s just — you’re dead.",5
But I’m not better at anything else.,5
They glared at each other across the Pensieve.,5
"He went up to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake to find that he had attacked Ron,  or else slithered through the house after one of the others...",5
"“Well, why didn’t you do any last night?” Hermione asked him.",5
"She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy.",5
"“Look, we can get rid of all this easily.” She pulled out her wand.",5
"Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly.",5
"“Very good, Miss Granger!” said Professor Flitwick’s squeaky little voice and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all jumped.",5
It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked.,5
"The wizard nodded, the witch said, “Naturally.”  “The man has red hair and glasses,” said Dumbledore.",5
"“Ban us?” he said, and his voice sounded strangely distant.",5
"True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.",5
"“Very quiet, now ...” They crept forward and Harry saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal.",5
"“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she say — ” “Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.",5
He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened.,5
"It is nice of you to have come to see him — “Er,” said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, “actually, we were just — er — ”  But the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron’s feeble mutter of “going to have a cup of tea” trailed away into nothingness.",5
"Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney’s seat.",5
He’s living here in London now.” Harry swore under his breath.,5
"“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s direction.",5
"He was very white, and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual.",5
The only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got onto the pitch.,5
"I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies ... well, they’re called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on — on Muggle wounds — ” Mrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl.",5
The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be.,5
"“She’ll say I should’ve stopped them leaving, I should’ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something... Yeah, it’ll be all my fault...” “Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done anything!",5
blah blah blah ...is currently hiding in London\ ’ ” Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper.,5
There was a moment’s silence.,5
"“Yes, Neville’s told me all about you.",5
"With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge’s office ahead, Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione’s almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o’clock.",5
A warm breeze swept the alleyway.,5
"Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away.",5
"“It’ll clear it up in no time.” “All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch when I say so.",5
He could feel himself shaking.,5
Neville’s legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight.,5
“Didn’t they attack you when they saw you?” asked Hermione.,5
"“We’ve still got Transfiguration, if you’re bored you could test me... Here.” He held out his book.",5
"Harry caught Ron’s eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney’s side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was.",5
"The others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom, withdrew it, and then flung his shoulder again at the door.",5
"Then he looked up, smiling.",5
He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.,5
"“It’s all your fault, Harry — Mum can’t blame me at all!",5
I was ... prouder of you than I can say.,5
“Look what it does...” She reached up and tapped the hat with her wand.,5
"“Rodolphus ’s brother, Rabastan, was with them too.”  And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty.",5
"Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember.",5
“Voldemort’s got Sirius.” “What?” “How d’you — ?” “Saw it.,5
"I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadn’t, Professor Dumbledore wouldn’t have been able to save him, would he?",5
"“Ginny’s had a word with us about you,” said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off onto the floor.",5
"Luna was already in place, sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day.",5
Ron was still white-faced and silent.,5
"“You’re a r-really good teacher, you know,” said Cho, with a watery smile.",5
"“I haven’t finished with you, boy!” “Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly.",5
"“This one looks okay, though,” said Harry slowly, scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley.",5
"“Well, you already know, don’t you?” said Mr. Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry.",5
"Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill?” “He’s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,” said Bill.",5
"Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus.",5
“I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was.,5
"“Yeah, well, I don’t blame you!” said Ron angrily, setting down his study schedule.",5
Nobody laughed; most of them looked too scared to make a sound.,5
"“The boy’s seeing things from inside You-Know- Who’s snake... Obviously, Potter doesn’t realize what that means, but if You- Know- Who’s possessing him — ” Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face.",5
He fell asleep  contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.,5
"“Wash out your mouth,” said James coldly.",5
"The four long House tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows.",5
"But he’s also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once.",5
"Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?” He turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks.",5
"“You should be proud, Neville,  proud).",5
"“Was that another goal?” asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view.",5
"“Now if yeh’ve finished askin’ stupid questions, follow me!” He turned and strode straight into the forest.",5
"“There she is...” Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks.",5
I’m off to try and find the Bloody Baron...,5
"He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.",5
“Where’s Hagrid?” he said out loud.,5
"Meanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving  soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic locomotion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around the edge of the table.",5
"He doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left — ” “Good,” said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement, “I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then — ” And moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had reappeared in her picture too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, “Yes, they’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, Dumbledore...",5
They would not be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed.,5
Snape’s head jerked upward; he was gazing at the ceiling.,5
"“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?” “I think so,” said Harry quietly.",5
"“You were only muttering a bit,” he mumbled apologetically.",5
"“I don’t want to hear anything you’ve got to say!” “You will,” said Dumbledore sadly.",5
"“Dementors here?”  “Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” shrieked Mrs. Figg.",5
"“Squash him — squash him, he’s only a pawn, you idiot — sorry, Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?” “Professor Snape, dear.",5
“An owl was sent to you this morning.,5
"“Wotcher, Harry!” “Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,” said a bald black wizard standing farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear.",5
She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.,5
"He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy... “Bearing south!” shouted Mad-Eye.",5
"Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful toward the place at the moment.",5
"Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half — ” “ ‘ — which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re putting in the adverts, anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket.",5
"and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping of the others’ robes, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air.",5
Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.,5
"“Oh, my goodness,” she said faintly, staring into the entrance hall.",5
"“Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all come through this... and P- P-Percy’s not talking to us... What if something d-d- dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up?",5
The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the end- of-term feast.,5
"You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated — to his cost.",5
Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday’s Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down.,5
“Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson?” Harry could not speak.,5
Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower.,5
"Mr. Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase.",5
"level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren’t they?",5
Come on ... look round ... I’m sitting here all alone... Come and have ago...,5
"They had not quite recovered from the shock of Luna’s hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey.",5
"He ran the other way, back past his staring companions.",5
Cho Chang walked into the hall with her friend Marietta.,5
"?” “Teach him English, yeah,” said Harry.",5
“This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.” Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them.,5
"and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose.",5
"“But why haven’t you got Occlumency lessons anymore?” said Hermione, frowning.",5
"“I suspect it is simply my good looks...” A sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite, staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him.",5
"The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together, whispering and giggling.",5
"The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony.",5
"“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Ron’s voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room.",5
"Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione.",5
"“Don’t touch it, it could be dangerous!” “It’s addressed to me,” said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice.",5
"“You’re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?” said Ron, leaning in for a closer look.",5
"Umbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze’s warning to Hagrid.",5
"“Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny’s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but ...” Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed.",5
"“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she ... er ... well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too ...” “She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry.",5
"Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered.",5
"“The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return?",5
"“Bear southeast and keep climbing, there’s some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in!” called Moody.",5
"Without the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor below.",5
"The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was filling the room.",5
"He swung his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more.",5
"He bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father  tormenting Snape.",5
"“Which brings us back to Occlumency.” Snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and Harry tensed in his chair, but Snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair.",5
"“It’s very simple — I’d had a very long day, dozed off, got sneaked up on, and bitten.” “Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?” asked Fred, indicating the newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside.",5
He exchanged another nervous look with Hermione and then stared out of the window.,5
Harry was sitting on the end of Ron’s bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sunday Prophet.,5
"But as it’s the last night, I really do need them back, so I’ve been putting up signs.” She gestured toward the notice board, upon which, sure enough, she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea for their return.",5
He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten.,5
He felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him.,5
"She glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face.",5
"“We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius — ” “Don’t go calling for him, though!” Hermione said urgently, but Harry had never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the time being.",5
"Sure enough, he found the written exam difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion: He could describe its effects extremely accurately, having taken it illegally in his second year.",5
"“Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know ... Of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted...",5
"Then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch — he was going to have a fly on Ron’s broom and savor their freedom from studying... “Turn over your papers,” said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass.",5
"“Okay,” Harry said aggressively to Hermione, “Okay, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I’m with you, otherwise I’m going to the Department of Mysteries right now — ” “The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly surprised.",5
"“I expect you’d like my autograph, would you?” “Hasn’t changed much, has he?” Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned.",5
"“Our job’s to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt — ”  “No one’s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice.",5
"“Tonks told me how to find out,” said Ginny.",5
What on earth are we going to do?” It did not feel as though they had won the match at all.,5
Professor Umbridge was  making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out.,5
"“That’s why he was happy last night...” “I don’t believe this,” snarled Harry, “Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?” “What other options does he have?” said Hermione bitterly.",5
He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?),5
"The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit.",5
"He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible  thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.",5
The silence within the office was absolute.,5
"He ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls had begun to rotate again.",5
"Acciol” More than a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick’s outstretched arms, knocking him backward off his feet.",5
"“I know,” said Ron in a low voice.",5
"I’m a really slow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be able to make lots more.” “You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly.",5
Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch.,5
"“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted.",5
"Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room.",5
"“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying back out of the room.",5
We’ve come to take you away.” Harry’s heart leapt.,5
"“Harry, I think I’m doing it!” yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to his first ever D.A.",5
"Harry’s centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione had been dropped too, and Harry hurried toward her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap.",5
"Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely room to  move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files.",5
“Harry Potter ... she ... she ...” Dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist: Harry seized that too.,5
"“Are you okay, Harry?” asked Ginny quietly.",5
"He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up, and started to dress.",5
"“Anyway, we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar.” “What about — ?” Ron began, but Hermione said quickly, “We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.” “Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we don’t think it’s anything to really worry about.",5
"“But what if that’s the one?” said Ron, staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing.",5
"“Harry,” he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes, and talking, “you’ve got to tell — ”  “I haven’t got to tell anyone,” said Harry shortly.",5
“Isn’t that what he was doing the night he was  supposed to be tailing me?,5
"Harry stabbed the number nine button, the grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling and rattling.",5
"When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard.",5
"Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker, and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off.",5
"He Disapparated from the front of my house!” “Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies under a car just in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and warned me, but by the time I got to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore going to say?",5
"Now, Father’s been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda Marchbanks — we’ve had her round for dinner and everything...” “Do you think that’s true?” Hermione whispered to Harry and Ron, looking frightened.",5
"What was this weird connection between them, which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily?",5
"“Blimey ... inspectin’ people, is she?” “Yeah,” said Harry, pulling the cloak off.",5
"As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the floor, he saw that they were all looking at him with awe, apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom they seemed to find intimidating.",5
"“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat.",5
"“Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die...",5
"She was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other, her broom lay abandoned several feet away.",5
“You haven’t got a clue... You don’t know ...” “What don’t I know?” asked Dumbledore calmly.,5
Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry.,5
"At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure.",5
"Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.",5
"“Hagrid, hide our mugs!”  Hagrid seized Harry’s and Ron’s mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang’s basket.",5
"“I see no snag, Dumbledore!” “Well,” said Dumbledore apologetically, “I’m afraid I do.” “Oh really?” “Well — it’s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to — what is the phrase?",5
"“Let’s go,” called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps.",5
"“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor Umbridge simpered, “for those kind words of welcome.” Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again, Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan.",5
"“You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.” “Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.” Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed.",5
"He ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed... Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes.",5
"“You — er — feelin’ all righ’, are yeh?”  Harry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid’s face that he was not referring to Harry’s physical well- being.",5
They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest.,5
The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one.,5
"The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider Wizarding community.",5
The wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like A CLEAN CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES ARE ANTI-DONTS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER.,5
“Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses?,5
"“Your father knew what he was getting into, and he won’t thank you for messing things up for the Order!” said Sirius angrily in his turn.",5
“Anyway ...” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape’s essay.,5
"“But why sack Hagrid now?” asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head.",5
"“We’ll have to, Harry, shell force it out of you anyway, what’s ... what’s the point... ?” And Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode ’s robes.",5
"“It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on.",5
Have you been furious with us?,5
"“He’s right, I don’t want to share a dormitory with him anymore, he’s a madman.” “That’s out of order, Seamus,” said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red, always a danger sign.",5
"“Not here, boy!” snarled Moody.",5
"Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry’s head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react.",5
All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway.,5
"“Expelliarmusl” said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand.",5
"If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back!",5
"“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,” said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework.",5
That’s what we call it when it goes all dark like this.” “I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.,5
"Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident.",5
"“I don’ want ter spoil the surprise.” “Look, Hagrid,” said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, “Professor Umbridge won’t be at all happy if you bring anything to class that’s too dangerous — ” “Dangerous?” said Hagrid, looking genially bemused.",5
"Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to “borrow” a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day.",5
"“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying SECURITY.",5
"“ Don’t leave it till later, you big second-rateri” chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridge’s homework.",5
"He never varied the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space.",5
The  plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in.,5
"Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position.",5
"“What has he come for, Kreacher wonders?” “Where’s Sirius, Kreacher?” Harry demanded.",5
I’m supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out.,5
"Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff.",5
"“Well — no — he didn’ want ter come,” said Hagrid, sounding desperate.",5
"I was there, I saw it...",5
"and was absorbed in the exam: As he reread his answers he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.",5
Someone behind him was laughing.,5
"“Kindly continue with your work!” And she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath.",5
"That could do with a bit of cleaning, too — Scourgify — ” She pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage; a few feathers and droppings vanished.",5
"""... Now he’s in the Order and everything.” “Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,” said Ron sagely.",5
"“He asked me out, you know,” she said in a quiet voice.",5
"“Professor Dumbledore says his name,” said Harry quietly.",5
"“Wand out, Potter.” Harry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk between them.",5
Ron’s brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench.,5
Once more he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra.,5
Everyone was trying to do some last-minute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very far.,5
"You can’t let her get away with this!”  “I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over her,” said Harry.",5
"“Impossible,” said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon.",5
"""... ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous .",5
He’s absolutely refusing to believe it’s happened.” “But why?” said Harry desperately.,5
"It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray clouds.",5
AVADA KEDAVRAl” Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist.,5
"“Dumbledore will be back before long,” said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to Harry’s story.",5
"“I’m sorry, Grawp, I don’t know!”  “GRAWP WANT HAGGER!” One of the giant’s massive hands swooped down upon them — Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backward and fell over.",5
"“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face.",5
"“Out — out — OUT!” And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry’s books, bag, and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran.",5
"The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.",5
"“You’re still looking a bit peaky...” “I feel absolutely fine,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his good arm to give Ginny a hug.",5
"The Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort’s up to — ” Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.",5
The door closed again and there was silence.,5
"Perhaps tonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night — “Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week — ”  “Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader’s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to unclench.",5
"“And just look at these books!” said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes.",5
"He had expected it to be empty, but it was not.",5
"“If you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again.",5
"Umbridge was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling upon some of her pink parchment, but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.",5
One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion.,5
"“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley said after a few seconds.",5
"Anyway, once you’re back on the team — ” “Ginny, I’ve got a lifelong ban.” “You’re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,” Ginny corrected him.",5
"“Whatever yeh say, blood’s important...” And he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.",5
And now he’s given her the power to inspect other teachers!” Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright.,5
"Harry’s mother ... “All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature.",5
thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end.,5
"He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs. Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, “I’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight too.",5
"“I forgot...” “No matter, Potter,” she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner.",5
"Dean, who had been bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard.",5
"Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them upside down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her.",5
He looked around; Fred and George had come to join them.,5
“No!” said Hermione in a hushed voice.,5
"“That Umbridge woman’s foul,” she said in a low voice.",5
"He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell.",5
With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions.,5
"“Harry, d’you want to chip in a couple of Galleons?",5
The sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.,5
"With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry’s hand, to himself, then at Hermione.",5
The nearest streetlamp went out with a pop.,5
Hannah Abbott’s eyes were as round as Galleons.,5
"You’re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.” “I am working!” said Harry, nettled.",5
"“So, how was Quidditch practice?” “It was a nightmare,” said Ron in a surly voice.",5
Harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk.,5
"“I’m not allowed to ask a simple question?” “Oh forget it,” said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence.",5
"Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and vanished behind them.",5
"The place was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects that were drifting around lazily in the liquid.",5
“I mean ... can you remember — er — where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen?,5
"“So ... been enjoying yourself, Potter?” “N-no ...” said Harry, trying to free his arm.",5
"No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking their way through the trees now, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness.",5
"The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake.",5
"Weasley’s patched her up,” said Hermione.",5
"Stand up, Potter!” Harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them.",5
I did it...” He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care.,5
“Where — where are the others?” gasped Harry.,5
"What on earth does that stand for?” “ Troll,’ ” said George promptly.",5
“Look at today!” groaned Ron.,5
"Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.",5
"In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harry’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on his broom...",5
"“Hurry, Filch, hurry!” shrieked Umbridge.",5
"‘Tm doing eight,” said Ernie, puffing out his chest.",5
"“I — yes,” said Ernie, “yes, I do believe that, it’s just “Ernie, do you really think I’d leave that list lying around?” said Hermione testily.",5
They faced each other with the desk between them.,5
The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the three of them scrambled back through it.,5
"“I think 111 go to bed,” said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got.",5
"Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out again...",5
"HARRY POTTER The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive.",5
Huddled together they backed away into a corner.,5
"Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life.",5
He’d have to try and finish the essay tomorrow.,5
"The new captain, Montague, was built along the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms like hairy hams.",5
"I put my trust, therefore, in your mother’s blood.",5
"Leaving the doors wide behind him, he strode forward through the circle of onlookers toward the place where Professor Trelawney sat, tearstained and trembling, upon her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her.",5
"“Very well, Alice dear, very well — Neville, take it, whatever it is...”  But Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper.",5
He did not look at Mrs. Weasley.,5
You had your head in my fire.,5
“I got famous because he murdered my family but couldn’t kill me!,5
"“Right, well, I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year.",5
"But before Harry could think about the matter any further, he heard a voice calling his name.",5
He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside.,5
"“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though — ” “Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said.",5
"Luna, on the other hand, sang, “Weasley Is Our King” dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.",5
"“I ’spect he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?” “I suppose so,” said Hermione, who looked tearful.",5
"“Look — you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous.",5
"He’s in a bit of a funny mood, you know.",5
"“I think we’re well shut of him,” said George with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face.",5
"“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear him, “the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.” “Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said Harry out of the side of his mouth.",5
"He sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as he had done on that occasion.",5
"“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the hearing,” he said.",5
"A split second later he realized that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy.",5
"“I mean, what was all that about?",5
"“Aha!” shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at McGonagall.",5
"“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister.",5
"As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of him.",5
Once more the wall spun and became still again.,5
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?” Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class.,5
If they were too late .,5
"I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn’t get it.",5
"Should I — ?”  “No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge’s balcony, and hastened past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.",5
Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them.,5
"The lock clicked open, and they entered the office.",5
"“The Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them, Lee put us onto it...” George yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky.",5
An odd feeling rose in Harry — an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius’s death.,5
"After a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge; Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D.A.",5
"“Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?” inquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko’s bags.",5
"“The Ministry suspects he’s one of Dumbledore’s lot so — I dunno — they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn’t trying to get through a door at all!",5
"One by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing defeat, followed suit.",5
"“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.",5
"“I ... must ... not ... look ... like ... a ... baboon’s ... backside...” Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood.",5
"“Ron, think about it... Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic...",5
His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly toward the dais.,5
"“Thirty-nine years this December,” said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut.",5
Harry understood why: Bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed.,5
"Potter,” said Umbridge, “let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October.",5
"“We’ll send a message round to everybody when we’ve got a time and a place for the first meeting.” She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something.",5
"“For permanent spell damage, you know.",5
"“Follow Tonks, Harry!” Harry followed Tonks into a dive.",5
Harry and the others followed.,5
"And it might  have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too,” Hermione added as an afterthought.",5
"Your death will not come as a great shock...” “Longbottom?” repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face.",5
"Harry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely.",5
His eyes were both blackened.,5
"And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than ‘Outstanding’ in their O.W.L.s, so — ” Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.",5
"And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first place... Don’t be stupid, you haven’t got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking.",5
It sounded as though every word was causing him pain.,5
"“Two coffees, please,” said Cho.",5
“But you won’t talk to me!,5
"“You’ll be safe once you’re in the grounds,” said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road.",5
"“Got it,” he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it.",5
"Er — before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a ... a favor.” Her bulging eyes narrowed.",5
"But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!” “Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you!” said Hermione, throwing a furious look at Ron.",5
"The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had all disappeared, and he was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound.",5
"They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.",5
"“Let’s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring the ball crate out for us.",5
"The star- strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished.",5
"In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow.",5
“Very nice to have met you all.,5
"“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply.",5
"Oh, the trouble this is going to cause!",5
"Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it — ” “Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred.",5
"“Look,” she leaned toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forward to listen too, “you know the first weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade weekend?",5
"“For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron.",5
“It was foretold that we would meet again.”  Harry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof- shaped bruise on Firenze’s chest.,5
This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough.,5
"“Only ... only wizards.” “Oh,” said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief.",5
"“ — and Alicia passes back to Angelina!” Lee shouted, and as Harry swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing.",5
"“I’d had enough.” “Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him.",5
"“I s’pose Lord Voldemort’s just a warm-up act compared to you three — what’s the matter?” he said, for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name.",5
"Sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry.",5
"Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler, but the students were several steps ahead of her.",5
"“Yeah, it is,” said Ron.",5
"He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse...",5
“Not in big groups like that.,5
The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously upward like a spiral escalator.,5
"“Take her!” He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down.",5
The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness.,5
“I s’pose we’re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is?” Ron demanded.,5
"“But Harry, you’ve just said it,” said Hermione fiercely.",5
"“Wha?” said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face.",5
"“Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,” said Hermione at once.",5
Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the  ground.,5
"I’ve got loads of homework to do...” And he traipsed off to the boys’ stairs, leaving her looking slightly disappointed behind him.",5
"year too!” “Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we?” said Harry.",5
"“Nothing we can do about it if it is,” said Ron gloomily.",5
"“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually.",5
"Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.” “He used to be a Death Eater,” said Ron stubbornly.",5
"And they couldn’t risk him getting better, could they?",5
"“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts.",5
Chairs slid backward again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends.,5
"Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and  inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present... “I don’t wonder you’re shocked, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face.",5
"The last he had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.",5
"Don’t they think I’d rather it’d never — ” “We know, Harry,” said Ginny earnestly.",5
where the wizard is desirous .,5
Then he reminded himself that dummies could not hear anyway.,5
"“He’s not an adult either!” said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks.",5
"“Now hand over whatever it is you’re sending.” Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, “I can’t, it’s gone.” “Gone?” said Filch, his face contorting with rage.",5
"“Harry, look what’s happen — no — no, I don’t like it — no, stop — stop — ” But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now.",5
"“I’d like you to make a prediction for me,” said Professor Umbridge very clearly.",5
To our old hands — welcome back!,5
It’s just been Kreacher and me here...” There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius’s voice.,5
"He walked slowly up the corridor then, when he had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear him, broke into a run.",5
"He had expected it to feel cold, but it did not.",5
"“While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it’s hard to convince people he’s back, especially as they really don’t want to believe it in the first place.",5
"He glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised.",5
"I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn’t you?” Everything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies’ girlfriend had even unglued herself to look around at Cho crying.",5
"“You know,” said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, “if Montague doesn’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.” “Yeah, I s’pose so,” said Harry, glad of a change of subject.",5
"Well, now, I couldn’t have that.",5
"“I don’t like being back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room.",5
"He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her.",5
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass.,5
"October extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces.",5
"The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.",5
"“What’s he brought all those cauldrons for?” “Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said Harry.",5
"He knew that voice too, though he hadn’t heard it for more than a year.",5
“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry.,5
I told you that three drops would be sufficient.”  Umbridge flushed.,5
"“I don’t know if there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even.",5
"“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl.",5
"“It’s something to do with me, isn’t it?” “Don’t, Harry,” said Neville suddenly.",5
"Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains.",5
"He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus.",5
"An’ I’ll tell yeh this, she’s not afraid of roughin’ it, Olympe.",5
"Gazing blearily around, he reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird’s nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it — eggs fell like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself.",5
"Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he’d ever found anything less funny in his life.",5
"“So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘Nymphadora, ’ ” muttered Tonks.",5
"“That Zacharias bloke’s a wart,” said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance.",5
But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again; he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius.,5
"There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows.",5
"Disentangling himself from his robes, he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, “Petrificus Totalusl” and Snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.",5
I’ll give you a lesson — ” Harry had been edging around the fountain on the other side.,5
"“A great bold headline: ‘Potter Accuses ...’A subheading: ‘Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.’ And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you: ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who’s attack, Harry Potter, 1 5, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being Death Eaters...’ ” The Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face.",5
asking me how the cleaning’s going — ” “What cleaning?” asked Harry.,5
"My herd has banished me.” “Herd?” said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she was thinking of cows.",5
"A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody’s office.",5
"“Look, I didn’t learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!”  Kreacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic.",5
"“Better than Seamus’s anyway, he was just telling me.” “Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.",5
DO NOT LEA VE YOUR A UNT AND UNCLE’S HOUSE.,5
"Some looked apprehensive, others entertained.",5
“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto him.,5
"“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers — ” “Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new broom?” Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.",5
"“Montague shouldn’t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he?",5
"He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow.",5
"“Get back in position, she’s fine!” barked Angelina.",5
"He was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting.",5
"Harry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said, “Erm ... yes ... he’s very good.” “Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna, unfazed.",5
“Which one was Michael Corner?” Ron demanded furiously.,5
"“And I don’t know who you are.” “I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly.",5
“Don’t you get involved!” Hermione whispered urgently to him.,5
"“Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not fabulous,” she said bluntly.",5
"“I can’t believe it — where’s Hermione gone?” “She’s there,” said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire.",5
"Then, quite abruptly, she said, “But you shouldn’t have seen this at all, Harry.” “What?” he said, taken aback.",5
"After a while he said in a dull voice, “This is the worst I’ve ever felt in my life.” “Join the club,” said Harry bitterly.",5
He straightened up and looked behind him.,5
"I just hope we’ve got enough photographs!” “Listen to him,” said the Healer, taking Lockhart’s arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old.",5
He had seen a badge just like this on Percy’s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.,5
"“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed.",5
Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they  mounted the verges.,5
"There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again.",5
"“Hi,” chorused Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all three kneeling down upon the hearthrug.",5
“We urge the magical population to remain vigilant The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defense that will be delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the coming month.,5
She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s voice floated out of the window again.,5
"If they’d lived, life woulda bin diff’rent, eh?” “Yeah ...",5
"“Just in case there are more of them around... Oh my word, what a catastrophe ... and you had to fight them off yourself .",5
“We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back...,5
"Best, Harry Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider.",5
"“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly.",5
"( Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry’s head...",5
"She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in sinisterly sweet fashion.",5
"Ron took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across Ron’s drawing of the moon Io.",5
"“You want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,” said Kingsley in his deep, slow voice.",5
The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight.,5
"Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us.” “I dunno how yeh work that out,” said Hagrid impatiently.",5
"“If I hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you’ll have me to answer to.” “How touching,” Snape sneered.",5
“What are you asking me for?” Harry retorted.,5
"No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry bent down to open his bag.",5
A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort’s name.,5
"In fact, says Doris Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may not even have been present at the killings.",5
"There were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite.",5
A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain.,5
"Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary, she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television program.",5
"Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his parchment, and scrawled a few words.",5
"“Well, I think that went quite well,” said Hermione happily, as she, Harry, and Ron walked out of the Hog’s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later, Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of butterbeer.",5
"“Potter, when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage.",5
"Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them and found five words in Sirius’s handwriting: Today, same time, same place.",5
"“I am about to attempt to break into your mind,” said Snape softly.",5
"“Oh,” said Ron, his smile fading slightly.",5
"“Has someone been attacked again?” asked Ron, pulling Harry roughly to his feet.",5
"“We’ll ...” said Harry, already bound by his promise.",5
"Anyway, I was reading out our amendment ... hem, hem ...",5
"“What’s the matter?” asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed toward  breakfast.",5
"Other students, nearly all of them fifth years, sat at lamp-lit tables nearby, noses close to books, quills scratching feverishly, while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker.",5
"“No, he was murdered by Voldemort.",5
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully.,5
“I don’t think we are.” He turned to his twin.,5
A giant in the forest!,5
"He was talking about the weather... “Yeah,” said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl.",5
"Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione’s bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying.",5
"I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift.",5
"Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor.",5
"His mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor.",5
"It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft’s; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry’s face and the back of his neck.",5
"He felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage.",5
"Ran inter a couple o’ mad trolls on the Polish border, an’ I had a sligh’ disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha’, couldn’t’a bin smoother.",5
He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing.,5
Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling.,5
"“Who’s there?” said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below.",5
"“What’s in the Department of Mysteries?” “What did you say?” Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep satisfaction, that Snape was unnerved.",5
"Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading.",5
"“They’re so pretty!” “They’re not supposed to be pretty, they’re supposed to protect you,” said Harry patiently.",5
"“The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,” said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.",5
“But that night it all wen’ wrong.” “What d’you mean?” said Ron quickly.,5
"Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.",5
Like to earn a little extra gold?,5
He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.,5
"She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you’d all have been in real trouble, and she can’t say it for herself because she’s on duty tonight.”  “On duty doing what?” said Ron quickly.",5
"George did the Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat — ” “Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George.",5
"“That was an accident,” he whispered miserably.",5
"“ — we couldn’t fit in useless loser either — for his father, you know — ” Fred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about.",5
"Harry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning.",5
"“I mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room...” “It’s ... nothing,” said Harry.",5
"Predictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing: Weasley cannot save a thing, He cannot block a single ring .",5
"“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly.",5
The Wizengamot fell silent again.,5
"One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded, and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in — ” “When you say you were ‘on duty,’ ” Fred interrupted in a low voice, “what were you doing?”  “You heard your father,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, “we are not discussing this here!",5
"“Look, let’s get back to the common room, well be a bit more comfortable there...”  But the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise.",5
"For a long time, neither of them spoke.",5
"“Well what?” “Voldemorti” said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione winced.",5
"Ron and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville, and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster, then forced himself into the box after Luna.",5
"When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name too.",5
"Muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence.",5
"The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.",5
"The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him.",5
Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must not tell lies.,5
"“Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters, look at this — ” He showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut.",5
“Be polite and stick to the facts.” Harry nodded again.,5
"“It’s you,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.",5
"“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione vaguely, “Harry’s liked her for ages, haven’t you, Harry?” He did not answer.",5
"“He’s as good as,” said Mrs. Weasley fiercely.",5
"At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning.",5
"“To Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!” Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded.",5
"“Sit down, Harry,” said Sirius.",5
None of the students were going to bed — they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed.,5
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.,5
"“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!” “I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasley ’s voice to permeate the room better.",5
“Dumbledore’sArmy.” Dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge.,5
"“And in case you hadn’t noticed, he hasn’t got ‘sneak’ written across his face — ” “That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger’s,” said Cho fiercely.",5
He thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy.,5
Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too.,5
"“ — but I bet she’d know what we’d done,” Fred said out of the corner of his mouth.",5
"He doesn’t want to be on his own with me, Harry thought.",5
"The ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise  directions; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added.",5
"He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side.",5
"“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, patting her on the head.",5
Most people returned to their telescopes.,5
"The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be.",5
"“What is it this time, my fine Potty friend?",5
"“Hagrid,” said Harry, unable to stop himself, “where are you getting all these injuries?” “Eh?” said Hagrid, looking startled.",5
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge!,5
He looked up at Ron.,5
"To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night.",5
"’ The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure.",5
Grawp had his back to them.,5
“They couldn’t keep him away in our second year and they won’t be able to this time.,5
"“Professor Dumbledore?” Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought.",5
I recognized him the moment I saw his picture in the paper.,5
"“Is it those mad horse things?” said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral Harry was patting.",5
“I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L.,6
"Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.",6
"Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.",6
"...” “I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered Hermione feverishly, “I definitely made at least one  serious mistranslation.",6
"“I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.” He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.",6
"“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it either,” said Dumbledore calmly.",6
Will you promise you won’t tell Mr. Burke I’ve got it?,6
He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them.,6
"“But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school.",6
"After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.",6
For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him.,6
"Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.",6
"Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand.",6
"...” “We must consult the governors,” said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape’s office.",6
"That’s only March for me!” “Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle ...” “Not the point, is it?",6
"“What happened?” “Cracked skull,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows.",6
I wonder when our O.W.L.,6
“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked.,6
"A blinding, sickening pain ... a flash of light .",6
"... I’m waiting for a telephone call, you see .",6
"To the Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove.",6
I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly.,6
“Not turned seventeen yet?” They shook their heads.,6
"“No ... from Professor Snape,” said Demelza.",6
"“Turning left?” “Big surprise,” whispered Ron.",6
"Likewise, the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.",6
"“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled Dean exuberantly.",6
"McLaggen, you  must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails.",6
"“Should be a laugh, eh?” “I dunno,” said Harry.",6
"He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings.",6
... It’s not a very good time for me.,6
"“But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don’t think you’ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what’s there first.",6
There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test.,6
He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry.,6
"“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused, “if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.” The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.",6
"The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness.",6
Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair.,6
You are advised not to leave the house alone.,6
Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.,6
"Weasley, I’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating?",6
"“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.” “Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn.",6
"“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly.",6
"This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harry’s best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to.",6
"We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.” Harry grinned.",6
"Seven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause ... seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise ... Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice.",6
“We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid.,6
"It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below.",6
"He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel.",6
Ron’s fist was drawn right back; his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.,6
"“They’re really cute!” “They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred.",6
"“A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection.” “Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister.",6
"“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks.",6
"“We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.” Harry’s stomach squirmed.",6
"“Well, I’d better be off.",6
Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me?,6
Would it have meant anything?,6
I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy.,6
...” ' When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk.,6
"“There you go,” said Fred proudly.",6
"Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her.",6
"... Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall.",6
"After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.",6
"And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself.",6
"Haven’t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?” “You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry.",6
He had known Ginny for years now.,6
"... You’ll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry.",6
"“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of the cubicles.",6
"“I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate.",6
"Ah, and this must be Petunia.” The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre- bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces.",6
"He continued to swim in Dumbledore ’s wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.",6
"It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.",6
"Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon — the vein pulsing in his uncle’s temple was reaching danger point — but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath.",6
"The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour taking office.",6
"Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff.",6
"Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.” “ ’Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his chair.",6
"“See this?” he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath.",6
"“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face.",6
Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones.,6
"As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late.",6
"Miss Granger loves them, don’t you?” “Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really — ” “So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded Slughorn.",6
"“Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities.",6
"“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,” said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore.",6
"...” “I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water.",6
"You left here early enough.” “Oh ...” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye imploded.",6
"His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.",6
"“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock.",6
"“But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now, we are quite alone, I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted.",6
"To Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Harry’s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.",6
"The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.",6
Got it?”  He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited.,6
"“And you’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or ... or to contact him in any way.",6
"“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !”  “There’s no point, Harry.” Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.",6
"And last night — ” Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn’t she?” “Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said Gaunt quietly.",6
"“Thanks, Ginny ... It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents.",6
"Oh, come and stir my cauldron, And if you do it right, I’ll boil you up some hot strong love To keep you warm tonight.",6
“Harry!” cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole.,6
The shock had taken a little while to wear off.,6
"“Are you pure-blood?” he asked, suddenly aggressive.",6
"While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by- the-by now.",6
"“So have you had a good term?” “Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna.",6
"He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined.",6
...” Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.,6
"“We don’t know.” “Someone couldn’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team, could they?” said Hagrid anxiously.",6
"“That’s my nickname,” he said.",6
"“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,” said Dumbledore.",6
"Always, I knew there was something.” “Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently.",6
"Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.",6
"“Petrificus Totalusl” yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.",6
He was still shaking uncontrollably.,6
"“Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.” Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.",6
"“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency.",6
"“No,” said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, “no, you’re not dead, you said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — Rennervatel” he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledore’s chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened.",6
“Do they work?” she asked.,6
"“Don’t be stupid — ” “Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now.",6
"“I think you were better off with the old one,” said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable.",6
“The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D’s!” said Twycross.,6
“It might have been a girl.,6
...” Harry stared at Malfoy.,6
Harry and the older Dumbledore followed.,6
“Hermione?” He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried.,6
He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere?,6
"He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had.",6
"Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.” “Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it ...” said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more.",6
"He handed over  his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles.",6
...” Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now.,6
Did you like him?”  “Er ...” Harry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not.,6
"The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty.",6
“You saved everything because you felt lucky.,6
"From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.” “But you think you’re right?” said Harry.",6
"He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.",6
"“I am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told.",6
"“No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,” said Dumbledore.",6
“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.,6
"Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, “Professor — I’m ready now.”  “Good,” said Dumbledore.",6
"All academic ...” “Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly.",6
"“And so what if he did, then?” Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden.",6
"“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting.",6
"“As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm, Harry.",6
He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it.,6
"“Well, reallyl” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust.",6
It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank.,6
"If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or dangerous, isn’t it?” “I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley slowly.",6
"“From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth.",6
"“Oh ... yes ...” said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness.",6
“Time’s ... UP!” called Slughorn genially.,6
"Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy.",6
"Mad, eh?” “Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s famous,” said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini ’s head, “or because their uncle — ” But he broke off.",6
“They were just discussing tactics.,6
"Pip pip!” With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches were moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories.",6
He must’ve upset them somehow.,6
"Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home.",6
"In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.",6
Madam Pomfrey burst into tears.,6
"Shall we walk on?” “Professor?” “Yes, Harry?” “Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?” “Into it?",6
Slughorn looked down at him in surprise.,6
“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!”  “This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!” said Ginny.,6
"Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored hair lank.",6
"You see ... she was Snape ’s mother!” “I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron.",6
“But obviously if you’d rather I hooked up with McLaggen ...” There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.,6
“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore did not answer.,6
"“You said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, “that there was time to turn back if we wanted to.",6
"...” The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified.",6
"...” To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point.",6
"“Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion?” Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half- Blood Prince’s notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay.",6
The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen.,6
"“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” he said bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.",6
Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window.,6
"Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon.",6
She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day — ”  “How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me tonight?” The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking.,6
"“I just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!” “I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly.",6
"Now, this one here ... yes, my dear?” said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione’s hand punched the air again.",6
"“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the hour,” said Fred.",6
"“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once.",6
"A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.",6
"“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?” “He’s dead.",6
The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.,6
"...” “Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth.",6
"“Can’t carry a tune to save my life.” “Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry quietly.",6
"As they sped toward the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air.",6
This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it.,6
"“There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness.",6
And ... and we suspect giant involvement.” The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall.,6
"“ ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top- quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling).",6
"Most Harry did not recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin.",6
"Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously.",6
"He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore ’s words; Harry had sent back his “yes” with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.",6
The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school.,6
"Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.",6
“It’s none of your business.,6
"Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better.",6
"How charming — ” “Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said Snape.",6
"“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,” said Tonks.",6
"You’d better go and change into your robes, all of you.",6
"“Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect ...” “Sir, I wanted to ask you something.” “Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away.",6
Fred and George had arrived at ten past.,6
"Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.",6
"“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.",6
“Now ... shall we proceed to the burial?” Hagrid nodded and moved forward.,6
"“I didn’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.” “Interested?",6
"“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound.",6
"“I’m used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time.",6
"The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming.",6
"Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual.",6
"“Snape kill Dumbledore — don’ be stupid, Harry.",6
...”  These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch.,6
"She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person.",6
He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry.,6
"So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.” “So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the request I made of you at Christmas — ” “What request?",6
"Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was ... ready-made.” He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, “I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I?",6
"He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall.",6
"Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him.",6
"“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school.",6
"In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him.",6
"“He was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm — ” “His Hand of Glory,” said Ron.",6
“But there was somebody already in there.”  “Somebody in — ?,6
"I’ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.” “Right,” said Harry unenthusiastically.",6
"Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.",6
"“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.",6
"“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it.",6
"“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name.",6
"“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this term’s project, and began pulling on their protective gloves.",6
"“Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders  he had not committed.",6
"He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face.",6
"“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door.",6
"Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully.",6
“I’ve got a meeting with him.,6
"They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.",6
She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon.,6
"There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.” “I’ll do it, sir, I’ll get it from him,” he said earnestly.",6
"Why?” asked Harry, more amazed still.",6
"Yours sincerely, Albus Dumbledore P. S. I enjoy Acid Pops.",6
"“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry.",6
The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him.,6
"“I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won’t budge.",6
"It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more  flustered with each visit.",6
"Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him.",6
“Is that all?” said Harry at once.,6
“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back.,6
Malfoy gave a harsh laugh.,6
"“If he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?” Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later.",6
He did not pause either for Hermione ’s gasps of horror or for Ron’s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.,6
"Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky.",6
"... “Out of here, quickly,” said Snape.",6
"Frustrated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went.",6
Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house.,6
"“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry,’ do you?” asked Ginny scornfully.",6
"If that’s how you treat teachers these days — ” “Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” said Dumbledore.",6
"“Oh, now,” he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him, “don’t go holding that against me!",6
"When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn’s only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.",6
“The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.” Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.,6
She was not the only one who had noticed.,6
"“Look, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests.",6
When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school — and I must say that Professor Dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle.,6
"“And if you don’t mind, I’d rather that door remained unlocked.” “I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or watched,” he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them.",6
"He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.",6
"His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery- blond.",6
"There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat’s prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center.",6
"Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to  cheer about.",6
"I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at  Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.” “But he didn’t get the job, sir?” “No, he did not.",6
"“If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression.",6
"“I believe you witnessed Katie’s accident.” “Yes, sir.",6
"“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a “ — murderer,” spat Harry.",6
"...” “I do,” said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed.",6
"I don’t think it can be just our family ... but I don’t know anyone else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t check.",6
A mere memory starting to act and think for itself?,6
"He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.",6
“I don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked her.,6
"Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.",6
"“I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.” “Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young  minds.",6
"Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get out!” Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father’s bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took.",6
“Thanks to Snape ...” “You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?” Ron continued.,6
"Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.” Filch ’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy?",6
“Aguamenti — Aguamenti — A GUAMENTP.,6
"I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach.",6
"Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating.",6
"Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway.",6
"“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table.",6
"While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.",6
"Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn.",6
"It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.",6
"“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” said Scrimgeour.",6
"“But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear.",6
He walked over to the door and knocked loudly.,6
"All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed.",6
"“Of course ... well, if you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll know that I don’t know anything — anything” — he repeated the word forcefully — “about Horcruxes.” He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket, and marched to the dungeon door.",6
"Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, “To friendship!",6
"As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens.",6
"“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow.",6
"Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione ’s arm and held her back.",6
"“Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?” Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.",6
"I’ve got no choice.” “Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine.",6
"The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry’s and Ron’s were still murky brown.",6
"“I walked into the room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the room, I mean.” “A voice?",6
“It was like having friends.” This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment.,6
"And now they’re calling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t you see why people are fascinated by you?” Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.",6
"Yes.” And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, “Ouch!” “Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore, straightening up again.",6
"“So, Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure?” Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.",6
"“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the message over Harry’s shoulder and was looking perplexed.",6
“Cough up.” “I’m your brother!”  “And that’s our stuff you’re nicking.,6
"Well” — he raised his mug high — “to Aragog.” “Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together.",6
"Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master’s soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley’s daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke.",6
"“Well, it wasn’t exactly your own work, was it?” she said stiffly.",6
"All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen — ‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction.",6
Ron’s was the only occupied bed.,6
"...” “Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says they’ll be all right.",6
"This strategy meant that  Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.",6
"“Surely that’s a little bit of an overstatement?” “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,” said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur.",6
"“I just don’t want my Quidditch team messed up again!” he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, “Harry!” giving him an excuse to turn his back on her.",6
"“I didn’t know he was going to come — ” “I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,” rasped Greyback.",6
So he wouldn’t have you anyway.” Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint.,6
3 WILL AND WON’T Harry Potter was snoring loudly.,6
"“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed.",6
"Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.",6
"But the question was, how to call him?",6
All the windows were dark.,6
"“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening.",6
"And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didn’t hear about that one — ” “Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister.",6
"Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot.” Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it.",6
"“But Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good for us.” The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts.",6
"The man on the horse?” “Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming.",6
"“I see it, I see it!” said Ogden hastily.",6
"“That had the Black family crest on it.” “I — no — what — ?” spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple.",6
"Harry, however, little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.",6
... They’re even quite fun sometimes.,6
"Harry’s heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore ’s spell — if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the cloak — “Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.",6
“So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly.,6
"As I doubt whether even the Half- Blood Prince ” — she gave the book another nasty look — “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with you, thatll stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance.",6
"Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal.",6
"“How do you know, Professor?” “Because he was doing detention with me.",6
...” There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.,6
"I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them.",6
"“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.” As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his knees and settled there, purring.",6
"“Oh, Harry, what can we say?",6
"“Won’t you sit down?” “Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured — the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present.",6
"“ — the lightning-struck tower,” she whispered.",6
"... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilized Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.",6
"“Cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly.",6
"She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her.",6
"The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry’s; he tried not to look into them.",6
"The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations.",6
“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry.,6
"Dad was already dead, but she didn’t want me to go too.",6
"“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again.",6
Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.” “What went wrong?” asked Harry.,6
“Confunded anyone lately?” She stormed up the table away from them.,6
So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only .,6
"“I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.” “IVo!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened his mouth furiously.",6
"“And when you’ve got your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.s ...” “Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically.",6
Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.,6
"All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?",6
“That ring — ” “Yes?” said Dumbledore.,6
The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed.,6
"Did you know that?” “I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice.",6
"The monster in his chest purred ... but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like “betrayal of trust” .",6
I didn’t know that could happen.,6
“D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked.,6
grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.,6
"“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she said.",6
“Defense Against the Dark Arts.,6
"""... and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk.",6
“It isn’t a question ...,6
I think he’s replaced his father as a Death Eater.” Mr. Weasley looked taken aback.,6
"I’d better go, Dumbledore ’s waiting — ” “No!” said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck.",6
He could not decide which of them was more annoying.,6
"He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.” “So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sitting up straight.",6
"“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence.",6
"“Personally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year.",6
"“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife.",6
"“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted.",6
"“I expect you’ve wiped the Muggle ’s filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot — ” “That’s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?” said Ogden.",6
"“And it ... it’s got something to do with the prophecy?” “It has everything to do with the prophecy.”  “Right,” said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same.",6
"He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, “You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell.",6
"“No more, please, no more ...”  Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin.",6
"“Well,” he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, “well, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased.",6
"What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.",6
"He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been.",6
"In a minute’s time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins.",6
I mean ...” He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear.,6
"“Always the same, weren’t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing.",6
Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries.,6
A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.,6
“I love being a sixth year.,6
and he wants to reserve something in there.,6
"“If it hadn’t been for the Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sitting here now.” “He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first year,” said Hermione dismissively.",6
"Either we’ve got Fudge, pretending everything’s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we’ve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!” “So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour.",6
"“It’s all right!” said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her.",6
I think I may have done great damage that day.,6
"Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.",6
"There’s going to be an inquiry, actually.",6
"“Just drink this ... It’ll be over ... all over!” Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face.",6
"She hiccuped loudly, patted her hair, and pulled herself up on Harry’s helping arm.",6
"Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.",6
"He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much.",6
But he thinks we liked the stupid subject D’you reckon anyone’s going to go on to N.E.W.T.,6
"That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!”  “And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically.",6
"Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?”  Voldemort looked coldly surprised.",6
"“It’s mainly ...” “Snogging,” said Harry.",6
"...” “Yeah,” said Harry, “well, now you’re back and Ron’s fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing  Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup.",6
"However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short  of his goal of six when he entered your parents’ house with the intention of killing you.",6
There was still no door.,6
"Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.",6
"“But Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be!",6
"Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand.",6
"“If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts — ” “Of course I am!” “Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’ ” Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, “I’m sorry, sir.",6
"“The sensation does take some getting used to.” “I’m fine,” said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly.",6
"They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all.",6
"It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron.",6
"“Yes, but don’t go arresting anyone now, dear, we’re in a hurry,” said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list.",6
"She does not know — and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.” Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, “But never mind my staffing problems.",6
"In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion.",6
Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news.,6
...” “But why did you keep him alive?” “Have you not understood me?,6
...” Fred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically.,6
"Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow.",6
"“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your determination to occupy the visualized space!",6
"“The diary, Riddle’s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.” “I don’t understand, sir,” said Harry.",6
"... “Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,” said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry’s cauldron.",6
"“We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor ... and oh, it’s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!” “It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly.",6
Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them.,6
"It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.” “But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.",6
"“I know she’s insane, but it’s in a good — ”  He stopped talking very suddenly.",6
“We’ll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn’t have to go into work again.,6
"“Well, that’s really all I had to say.",6
"“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away, please!” But Harry did not lower his wand.",6
"Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.",6
"Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.",6
The wardrobe burst into flames.,6
Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak.,6
"“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.”  “Have you, have you ...” said Scrimgeour.",6
"Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room.",6
"“Parsnips, Remus?” “Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out;  Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.",6
Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall.,6
"He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top.",6
"“Thanks a million,” said Ron.",6
“Um ... just a mo’ ... MRS. COLE!” she bellowed over her shoulder.,6
"Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.",6
"“When I first heard it, I was .",6
“ — everyone should be comfortable.,6
"After a few moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself.",6
"“Mundungus!” The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.",6
"Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “Specialis Reveliol” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.",6
"This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.",6
“She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.” She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door.,6
"“Well see,” said Harry confidently.",6
"Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.",6
“I dunno whether it’s worth me taking the test.,6
“We wanted to see you.” “We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously.,6
"You understand?” Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light.",6
"“Tonks deserves somebody young and whole.” “But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile.",6
"He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to go\” and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed.",6
"He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry’s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius.",6
"For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing.",6
I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.” Mrs. Cole blinked.,6
"On my command, now .",6
"“Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too.” “I couldn’t,” said Harry.",6
“A job I do not want?,6
"So — when I’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this Hogwarts?” “All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,” said Dumbledore.",6
"If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection ...” Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.",6
"What can he do about it?” “That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, frustrated.",6
"He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job.",6
“That’s why I’m looking for something different.,6
"“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.” Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, “Do you wish to come with me tonight?” “Yes,” said Harry at once.",6
"“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them.",6
"“They were at Slughorn’s party together, but I don’t think it went that well.” Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.",6
"“Can I borrow your silver knife?” She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.",6
"If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow.",6
"“If Ginny and Dean aren’t speaking ...” “Oh — oh yeah,” said Harry.",6
"His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites.",6
Snape’s not going to be pleased.,6
"“Yes, something horrible has happened here.” Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet.",6
"Personally, I’m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death.",6
“I — what?” “A Wrackspurt ... They’re invisible.,6
The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued.,6
"“Yes ... yes, this’ll make it stop,” lied Harry.",6
"“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?” It had been his last, desperate hope.",6
“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle’s history?,6
"He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start.",6
"He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke.",6
“We ought to check that there’s nothing odd about it.,6
"Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.",6
“It doesn’t look like it was built for two people.,6
‘He’ll kill me for losing his ring.,6
"“Be over soon.” “No problem,” said Harry, grinning.",6
"Pick it up, have a good look!” whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings.",6
"Darkness descended fast as they walked, and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest.",6
He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even worse to hear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.,6
"His father’s a Death Eater and — ” Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open.",6
"Two or three hours should do it.” “It’s a great feeling when you take it,” said Ron reminiscently.",6
“What happened to his hand?” gasped Hermione.,6
"But that’s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace — ” “You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?” “No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him — ”  “But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no — “Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said Harry angrily.",6
"There could be only one conclusion, in Harry’s opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.",6
"“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls.",6
"“How did Katie get hold of this?” “Well, that’s why we were arguing.",6
"“But it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.” It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledore ’s wand.",6
Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making with a sulky expression.,6
results would be arriving today!” “Today?” shrieked Hermione.,6
Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment.,6
But Dumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.” Harry looked mockingly all around the shop.,6
"“Hagrid, he killed ...” “Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry.",6
"But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else.",6
The Ministry wasn’t so keen to be pals last year.” They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet.,6
"“Old age, in short ... One day, perhaps, it will happen to you ... if you are lucky.",6
"“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, Tom’?” Harry nodded.",6
"The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else’s path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.",6
A startling thought had just occurred to him.,6
"There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn’t have been there.” “Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked ... but this is something different.",6
"“Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes ... and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?” “She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ” “McGonagall!” said Ron warningly.",6
"He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.",6
"Oh dear, dear, dear.” Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink.",6
"I’d never have believed it of you, Harry!” “Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back.",6
"But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky — Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.",6
And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders?,6
"The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.",6
“I can’t remember enjoying commentary more!,6
"The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight.",6
"“Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress?” “That’s the one,” said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately.",6
An’ thanks fer not givin’ Harry detention neither.,6
How did you do it?” But Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as Harry was.,6
You must be Mr. Dursley.,6
"... “Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that book when that spell — ” “Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry.",6
"“Lumos.”  Dumbledore ’s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway.",6
"Good night.” Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled.",6
"When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow.",6
“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely.,6
Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb.,6
“What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard?,6
There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle.,6
“ What was that for?” Harry bellowed.,6
"I noticed that last year.” “I s’pose,” said Harry.",6
“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.,6
"“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly.",6
Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch’s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews.,6
"“Oh, good,” said Ron, relaxing.",6
"It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis.",6
"“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor ... too dangerous.",6
"“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled.",6
"Harry was standing stock- still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long.",6
"“No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch — ” She stopped and glared at him suspiciously.",6
...” And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done.,6
"Surely you can sort out — well — anything !” Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, “The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.” And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished.",6
And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and .,6
"Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled.",6
"“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin with a faint smile.",6
"Her  family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too.” Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking.",6
"“You can’t possibly — ” “Yeah, I can!” said Harry.",6
"He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving.",6
“We must follow the established procedures.,6
"“OUCH!” He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.",6
"“You can’t just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me — ” “I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour coldly.",6
"“It’s not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you!",6
"Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the castle’s occupants.",6
Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions?,6
"Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned.",6
"And you must be Mr. Longbottom!”  Neville nodded, looking scared.",6
I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.,6
"“What does it mean?” Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue glinting evilly above them.",6
"He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins ... or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?",6
"He’s gone.” “He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,” said Harry, smiling in spite of himself.",6
"“He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don’t know what he means by it.",6
"Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.",6
“Something that seriously scared Borgin.,6
"“You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.” “So I was,” Dumbledore agreed.",6
"Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.",6
"He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time.",6
Hermione patted her shoulder gently.,6
"“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be “serious.” “Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!” said Lavender fretfully.",6
“But there are some injuries you can’t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons without antidotes.,6
"“But surely werewolves don’t kill, they just turn you into one of them?” “They sometimes kill,” said Ron, who looked unusually grave now.",6
"sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections.",6
"Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.",6
He had only just remembered.,6
I am yours to command.” Dumbledore raised his eyebrows.,6
"The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.”  “At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned.",6
"“Undoubtedly,” he said, finally, “this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux.",6
"Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.",6
"Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation.",6
"It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically.",6
"As you have perhaps realized, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too.",6
"Can yeh believe that, Harry?” The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid.",6
"“Just like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it.",6
"“Thanks for ... everything.” “See you, Harry.” Snape did not speak for a minute or so.",6
Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful.,6
The three Death Eaters  fell back without a word.,6
"“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” said Dumbledore after a moment or two.",6
"“Harry, are you okay?” she added anxiously.",6
"Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days.",6
The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words.,6
"You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but — ” “Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon.",6
"It’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!” “My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Minister of Magic after all this?",6
"What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock.",6
"They laid him to rest with his hat inside out And his wand snapped in two, which was sad.",6
"Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed.",6
"He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the “Chosen One” rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight.",6
“But the weather’s good ... and Vaisey couldn’t play.,6
"In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore’s body and the table on which he had rested.",6
"An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea.",6
"Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levicorpus\ Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes hanging off him.",6
"Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron.",6
When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T.,6
"I’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going on our end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical population, I should say.",6
"“Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.” “He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.",6
"“I was looking forward to that!” “Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry.",6
"“And please don’t shout.” “But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?” “Harry!",6
“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s.,6
"“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it.",6
...”  Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to O.W.L.,6
"...”  But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.",6
"“But one of them jumped,” he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore ’s.",6
"However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.” “Why not, sir?” “You are with me,” said Dumbledore simply.",6
"Because you, yourself, will never rest until you’ve tried!",6
"... Coming, Ginny?” “No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic.",6
“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?” “Wha — ?,6
Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs.,6
"“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably.",6
What he would not give to fight Malfoy one-on-one .,6
"He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering  the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone.",6
"Harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron’s copy of Advanced Potion- Making into his bag as he did so.",6
"“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it.",6
He will continue to hunt you .,6
"“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.",6
He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people.,6
"“Are you going to Slughorn’s party tonight?” “No invite,” said Parvati gloomily.",6
"As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin ’s candle, extinguishing everything.",6
The full story could wait.,6
"“Why not Madam Pomfrey?” “Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping.",6
"Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little.",6
"“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window.",6
"He chortled again, and Harry joined in.",6
"“Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course — Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.",6
"You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse?",6
"At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.",6
“So the Ministry called upon Morfin.,6
"“The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that.",6
Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall.,6
"His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party.",6
"Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water.",6
"He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening.",6
"All that unfixed, indestructible stuff — ” “Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit like you.” “Like me?” “Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face Voldemort.",6
"“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn.",6
And I have destroyed another.”  “You have?” said Harry eagerly.,6
"...” “Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,” said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh.",6
"“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily.",6
"“The library is now closed,” she said.",6
... Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic.,6
"“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped.",6
"“Does he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?” “That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing.",6
"“Nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us.",6
"“If you do not want to give me a job -” “Of course I don’t,” said Dumbledore.",6
"If they lost ... well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings.",6
"I wondered whether it hadn’t become ... you know ... him.” “It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly.",6
"“She can’t complain,” he told Harry.",6
The lower rocks were slippery with seawater.,6
"It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.",6
The concentration within the room was almost tangible.,6
"“Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve seen it.” “Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,” said Neville, “but she was really pleased.",6
"“Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don’t you?",6
"“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys’ dormitories.",6
"“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.",6
"“And you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?” “S’right,” said Gaunt.",6
"“You’re the best Keeper I tried out, Ron.",6
You would certainly have been that.,6
"“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.",6
"“Well, I’ll see you all — OUCH!” Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat.",6
“I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of  Requirement.,6
"Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this.",6
"I jus’ saw them Death Eaters runnin’ down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em?",6
"He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard.",6
"I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?” “Yes,” said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.",6
He had a voice like none that  Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice.,6
"“But I still don’t know why she’d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s really why she was here.",6
"“Now, you, Cormac,” said Slughorn, “I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?” “Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen.",6
"“I wouldn’t be here to discuss it, would I?",6
Did that mean the death had occurred there?,6
"To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.",6
"“Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of them has ever been killed — well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort.” Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort’s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry ignored.",6
"You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you.",6
"“He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken.",6
"“He used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect,” he said.",6
"If it were a question of saving him — ” “ — I’d want to go even less,” said Ron firmly.",6
"although as they don’t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it’s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes.",6
"“Think!” said Snape, impatient again.",6
"“The Dark Mark,” he muttered.",6
"“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron’s head.",6
"All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore.",6
"“Why couldn’t he make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?” “Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,” said Dumbledore.",6
"“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too.",6
Best bargain we ever made!” Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come.,6
"I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us!",6
"It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron — ” “Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily.",6
“Be very careful not to step into the water.,6
"“It’s you two.” “Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.",6
"All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!",6
"They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he’d been caught at the Ministry he didn’t look happy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he?",6
"“Nothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I’m keeping you in overnight.",6
"Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer.",6
the one where I tell the world what a great job you’re doing in exchange for — ” “ — for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped Scrimgeour.,6
"“I know Lupin’s tried to talk her round, but she’s still really down.",6
"“He killed my mum and dad!” “You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said Dumbledore loudly.",6
"Of course, one doesn’t know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes — but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!” Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing.",6
"It’s just an old textbook someone’s scribbled on.” “But you’re doing what it says?” “I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there’s nothing funny — ” “Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at once.",6
“That was a clear instruction.,6
"Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone.",6
"“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted.",6
“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.” “What?” said Harry.,6
"He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see.",6
"Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement” — she jerked the  Prophet out from under Harry’s hand and unfolded it to look at the front page — “you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.” “Anyone we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.",6
"“He told me last night in your broom shed.” “Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore!” said Ron, looking impressed.",6
"Beside it, held in place by Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing.",6
"“Sir, are you all right?” “I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched.",6
"Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man.",6
"“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.",6
"“He’s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still — ” “We have discussed this, Harry,” said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again.",6
"...” He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid ’s, delighted with himself.",6
"But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it  perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.” “But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, so you had to leave!” said Harry angrily.",6
"“Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it’s a favorite pastime of his — ” “Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!” “Oh — in his office,” said Nick.",6
"about Horcruxes?”  Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass.",6
"“This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.” “Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!” said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.",6
"I should be sorry to believe half of them.”  Voldemort ’s expression remained impassive as he said, “Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies.",6
"“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady.",6
"So you see, it’s a very important job, and I tell him it’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.",6
Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry?,6
What kind of quill are you using?” “It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones ... but I think the charm must be wearing off.,6
"Still paralyzed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: It seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.",6
"“I see,” said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke.",6
"“They’re playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.” Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch.",6
"“How good’s this?” said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again.",6
“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — Wizarding community?” snapped the Prime Minister now.,6
"Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts.",6
"“ — it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you!” “Oh ... yeah, maybe,” said Harry, relieved.",6
"“I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?’ ” “Er,” said Harry, “were you?” “Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple.",6
He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape.,6
"... Eat your eggs while they’re warm, Harry.” Looking careworn, she left the room.",6
"“We’d better get our robes on.” Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head.",6
"“Yes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.” “And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.",6
"“This is ... not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, avoiding everybody’s eyes as he looked around distractedly.",6
"“D’you think I want people saying my sister’s a — ” “A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand.",6
"“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.",6
"At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance  and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air.",6
"The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a most Hermione-ish look on her face.",6
"“Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating!",6
I shall explain this more fully when I see you.,6
“Harry?” said Professor Trelawney again.,6
"“Yeah ... he might not make it.” “Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen.",6
"Yes, that was — was terrible indeed.",6
"Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ “So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?” said Harry.",6
"“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said Hermione a little impatiently.",6
"He stopped in his tracks, listening.",6
"“But what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.”  Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second?",6
Harry considered him for a moment.,6
"I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didn’t I?",6
"“I bet there has,” he said.",6
"“He was a genius, the Prince.",6
Mum’s only just told us!” “About one o’clock this morning.”  “Were the Muggles all right?,6
"Listen to me.” She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.",6
"The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light.",6
"“And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you?",6
"“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half- Blood Prince business,” she said tentatively.",6
"Catching Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be here in a moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.” “I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time.",6
"“What did you want to see him about?” “Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe.",6
“But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you all this.,6
"He did not knock upon Dumbledore’s door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered, “Enter” after Harry had already flung himself into the room.",6
"“Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t, won’t, won’t — ” “As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher’s continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” “Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.” “I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf.",6
"Look at the picture!” Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look too.",6
"Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful  properties.",6
"But I wish I could, Tom.",6
"See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore said I’d do,” said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets.",6
"“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.",6
"One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head.",6
“Harry ...” “Malfoy ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts.,6
"I shall see you at Hogwarts.” “I think that will do,” said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry’s side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office.",6
"“We’ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I’ll be off.",6
"When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime  Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office.",6
The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch.,6
"“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle — ” “Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction.",6
"The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser.",6
"“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding out his hand.",6
"For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.",6
She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin: There was a tiny hole in her glove.,6
"Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden .",6
Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at her.,6
“It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing.,6
"He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat — “Petrificus Totalusl” Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight.",6
"“What did you have to imitate her for?” “She laughed at my mustache!” “So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.” But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati.",6
"“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” Ron was saying happily.",6
Where’s he gone — was he chasin’ them?” “He ...” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke.,6
"Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.” Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard.",6
Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak.,6
"And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job!",6
Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you — ” “So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out.,6
"“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!” And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy’s wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow.",6
What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy.,6
"Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.",6
"Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.” “I didn’t — ” mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him.",6
"With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar.",6
"“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once.",6
"I know why it’s happened, of course.",6
"“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily.",6
"... Hokey, where are you?",6
"I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as me assistant.”  Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze.",6
“Nothin’ Dumbledore won’ be able to put righ’ ...” Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name.,6
"Hermione was peering into Fred and George’s boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry.",6
"The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected.",6
Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry.,6
Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them.,6
"But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day.",6
“Sorry ... looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now.,6
"Pumpkin juice?” “Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.",6
"“I’ve got the necessary here in my bag, it’s not a difficult antidote.",6
“Harry Potter?” said the girl.,6
"“He was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed.",6
"...” “Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ron’s booklist.",6
"“Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?” “The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested.",6
"“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course.",6
"“I merely wondered why you — who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister — ” “Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore.",6
"page 2, column 5) A second newspaper lay beside the first.",6
"Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home.",6
"“Let’s get goin’ then — after yeh, Molly, Arthur — ” The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s memory, completely empty.",6
"He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah ’s fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.",6
"While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment  has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.” A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius’s mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry’s mind.",6
Romilda Vane was amongst them.,6
Don’t you realize — haven’t you seen — ?,6
"“You care about me saying ‘Mudblood’ when I’m about to kill you?” “Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright.",6
"“Get out!” Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels.",6
"“Oh, I got in all right,” said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall.",6
"Harry looked over the top of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something.",6
"What’s Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense?",6
"“Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to do.",6
"A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius.” “Yes, but I meant — ” “I know what you meant.",6
"“He did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it.",6
There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.,6
"... “Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back.",6
...” Harry did not attempt to argue or explain.,6
"“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his  bulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.",6
"Obviously she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.” “Ah,” said Harry.",6
"“That was the one he nearly missed.” McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.",6
"“More of the same, really ... advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies, you know.” “Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?” “Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast, doesn’t he?",6
"“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,” interjected Ron.",6
"You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.”  “If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, “I — I — 111 — ” “Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning.",6
"And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.",6
"Well, they’ll have a bed, anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.",6
"A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase.",6
"I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others’ sake as much as his.",6
I don’t think he’s in his bed.,6
She said something about that Ron Weasley.,6
"He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse — Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid .",6
"“You ... you wouldn’t understand.” “Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.",6
"“Anything about the boy’s father, for instance?” “Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story.",6
"... And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now.",6
"Well, there’s nothin’ strange abou’ that!” Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning.",6
"I — I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn.",6
"“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed.",6
"“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck.",6
"“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione’s embarrassment.",6
"“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?” “Yes,” said Harry stiffly.",6
“But now at last we can speak plainly to each other.,6
"Here ...” Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore ’s mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.",6
"And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.",6
"“Why did you stay there all that time, Snape?",6
"Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!” “I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir,” said Harry stiffly.",6
"Malfoy’s hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus\ and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another — “No!",6
"“You dislike the name Tom’?” “There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle.",6
“Tricky conditions!” McLaggen said bracingly to the team.,6
The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts ’s history.,6
"“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.",6
"It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.”  Harry stared at him.",6
Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied.,6
"“And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.” Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode.",6
"Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible.",6
"Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn’t seven — ?” “Merlin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn.",6
"Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went.",6
"“Something more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.” Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.",6
"“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary.",6
"You will not use magic.” “Right, Professor,” said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables.",6
"“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said.",6
"“Well ... they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he said.",6
...”  Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy’s boasts.,6
"But you won’t tell anyone, Professor?",6
"Yes, very neat ... very neat ... Poor Mr. Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta’s.",6
"In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives.",6
"The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle- legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest.",6
"You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.” Harry stared at Snape.",6
He was not looking at Fenrir; he did not seem to want to even glance at him.,6
"“I like a quiet life, you know me.” She gave a watery chuckle and stood back.",6
"It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?",6
The centaurs had come to pay their respects too.,6
"“I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) — ” He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.",6
Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and George’s products.,6
"And all sorts of powers it’s supposed to possess too, but I haven’t tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here.",6
"With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor’s six goals.",6
"“But he healed all right, didn’t he?",6
"You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him.",6
"“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.",6
"He can tell I’ve been trying to get him on his own again, and he’s not going to let it happen!” “Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?” The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the  caretaker.",6
"But taken sparingly, and very occasionally ...” “Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great interest.",6
"“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again.",6
"“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation.",6
"“He was underage at the time, wasn’t he?",6
"“I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did.",6
"“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said Ron.",6
"I won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.” “But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?” “That’s right.",6
Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.,6
There was a moment’s painful silence.,6
"“A Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it’ll do us if you lot aren’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore.",6
Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl.,6
“You see!” said a strained voice.,6
Here — ” He shoved the Marauder’s Map into Hermione’s hands.,6
"“Look at the time, it’s gettin’ on fer midnight, I need ter — ” “Hagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?” Harry asked loudly.",6
“My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks.,6
But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.,6
"“It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn’t caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt!” “Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,” said Harry, still trying to sound casual.",6
"And, er — ” “My dad,” said Harry.",6
"The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces.",6
Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10).,6
"Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak, and waited, breath held.",6
“She’s gone a bit funny.,6
"about Horcruxes?” And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him.",6
"“Sir — what happened to your — ?” “Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore.",6
Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party.,6
"With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day.",6
"“Now drink that up, it’s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know.” “Brilliant,” said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.",6
"Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny.",6
Professor ... how can you be sure Snape’s on our side?” Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something.,6
"“So, Zabini,” said Malfoy, “what did Slughorn want?” “Just trying to make up to well-connected people,” said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle.",6
"After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room, where they grudgingly started Snape’s homework.",6
"It’s just because she’s Ron’s sister, he told himself.",6
"“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly.",6
"“What’s going on, Harry?” Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her.",6
"“Lean in a little, dear boy, so you can see.",6
You saved Ginny ... you saved Arthur ... now you’ve saved Ron ...” “Don’t be ...,6
"“But it’ll be a short visit, and then I’ll be gone for good.” “But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?” “I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry muttered.",6
Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.,6
"The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.” Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.",6
"“That’s right,” said Ginny staunchly.",6
"You’ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he’s always interested to hear my take on the day’s news.",6
"“And he’s hinting now that if I don’t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we’ll carry on next year.” He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny.",6
“The Prince only copied it out!,6
"He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore ’s inexcusable trust in Snape ... but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same.",6
"“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, “I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at his age.",6
... We don’t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens.,6
“And you’ve brought Alecto too.,6
"Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding world!",6
"What’s so special about her?” “A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction.",6
"Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed.",6
"Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls.",6
"and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day ... but then ...” And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort.",6
"I don’t think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don’t think he knew they were coming.” “It isn’t your fault, Minerva,” said Lupin firmly.",6
"Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade.",6
"But he did not know — he had no possible way of knowing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father — ” Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.",6
... What was the matter with him?,6
"Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth.",6
"Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner.",6
"...” Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more tightly around his neck, and said, “This way.” He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses.",6
"Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before.",6
"However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.",6
"His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward.",6
"There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.",6
"In fact, being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.” “Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “does what you’re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy?",6
"But how — ?”  “There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes.",6
"“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Ron’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat- Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand.",6
"It’s a big job, he’s got ten people reporting to him now!” “What exactly — ?” “Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters.",6
"There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: / must not tell lies.",6
"You look funny,” said Neville.",6
"Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he’s the one who wanted me to — ” “He is here,” said a voice behind Harry.",6
"“Hang on,” Ron said slowly.",6
"You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?” “And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and — ” But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.",6
"“We’re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.” “I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister.",6
"“You’ll have no trouble come July!” “I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.",6
"Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry’s eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks.",6
"“You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!” “I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much blame on yourself.",6
"“How did it happen?” “Snape killed him,” said Harry.",6
"He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.",6
"Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean.",6
"“Fight back, you cowardly — ” “Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape.",6
"“The Room of Requirement,” repeated Harry.",6
"Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts — ” “If you’re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus!",6
"His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.",6
"The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another.",6
"Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.",6
"Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?” “I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once.",6
"As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn ’s voice floated after them, “111 want a pay rise, Dumbledore!” Dumbledore chuckled.",6
"“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace ... are they for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine?” asked Dumbledore.",6
I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.” Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.,6
"“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds.",6
"“Somebody is putting up a good fight,” said Dumbledore conversationally.",6
"Is that blood?” Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at the sight of Harry.",6
"“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said, astounded.",6
"Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts “It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape.",6
"“Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it — ” “Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused.",6
“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily.,6
"“But now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “now things become murkier and stranger.",6
Madam Pomfrey says he won’t — won’t look the same anymore.,6
"“It’s taking longer than I thought it would.” Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say.",6
"He tried boosting Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice.",6
"The omens were never good, Harry.",6
“So?” “So I wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here.,6
Riddle took down the quaking box.,6
"Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything  to do with him.",6
"Frightens you?” “Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” said Dumbledore.",6
"“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling.",6
"“Should’ve made your presence known, shouldn’t you?” said Gaunt aggressively.",6
"“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly.",6
"“Dumbledore’s angry with Snape?” “I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway.",6
"I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and in any case,” she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, “I asked Borgin about the necklace, don’t you remember?",6
"“Come in, she’s on ’er way.” Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean.",6
But this was not Voldemort’s first choice of job.,6
"“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot.",6
He nearly died doing it.,6
"“I tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville.",6
"As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away.",6
"""... you know how to fix it?” “Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself.",6
But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul?,6
"Pushing open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door.",6
"“Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter.",6
The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand.,6
"...” Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?",6
"“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, frowning at Ron.",6
"“Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?” “Yes,” said Harry again.",6
“Now come!” he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry.,6
"Off you go!” There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but  nobody spoke.",6
"“I can fix your nose if you stand still.” Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes.",6
"“Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened?",6
"“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me ... and, even more unusually, with permission.” “Where are we going, sir?” “For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery- white substance.",6
"We heard a noise, and someone said something about the Dark Mark — ” began Ernie Macmillan.",6
"“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s hesitation, “but not unheard of.”  His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle’s face.",6
"They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.",6
"He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster.",6
I stepped over the body.,6
“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it.,6
"Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.",6
"“Stand back — ” But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.",6
Haven’t I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students?,6
"“I — Lupin told me.” This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve.",6
Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features.,6
"Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing.",6
"Dumbledore ’s hands lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt- looking as ever.",6
“Narcisscd” But Narcissa had rushed ahead.,6
"Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something that you need to be qualified for,” said Malfoy quietly.",6
“You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley.,6
"“Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthur’s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects.",6
"“Ah well,” said Slughorn cheerily, “as we’re so few, we’ll do something fun.",6
"“Protect her pretty neck?” “If I were on duty ...” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.",6
"I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.” He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction.",6
"“We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day — oi, come back here, Trevor!” And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.",6
"At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike.",6
"Dobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew.",6
"“Come in,” said Dumbledore’s voice.",6
“You’re doing what Barty Crouch did.,6
"“I wasn’t!” “Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late.",6
"“I’ve got a detention with Professor Snape.” “Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically.",6
"""... seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get a hundred Galleons a pint.",6
"Well — enjoy your breakfast, ’Arry!” With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.",6
"“The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious — if Lucius hadn’t — ” “Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my husband!” said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.",6
"The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-  Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift.",6
"Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.”  Harry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed.",6
"“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up.",6
"Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers.",6
"...” And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the ground.",6
"Indeed, many of the Dark Lord’s old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more.",6
"There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles  whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.",6
"“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione.",6
"Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence.",6
"“Shall I run and fetch — ?” “No, Harry can do it.” Harry raised his wand at once.",6
"“But you said — ” “Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it carried over all the  muttering, “will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” “No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction.",6
"... “If you don’t mind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, “I’d like a few words with you before we part.",6
Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.,6
"“Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,” said Dumbledore gently.",6
"Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not!",6
"The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, “He was nicking Sirius’s stuff.” “I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are staring,” whispered Hermione.",6
It was nearly fifty years old.,6
“I thought he might be.”  “He was a funny baby too.,6
"“He’s not very happy with me.”  “No,” sighed Dumbledore.",6
"He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.",6
"As he passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder.",6
"“You will not object to getting a little wet?” “No,” said Harry.",6
"Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.",6
"He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder.",6
"That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play!",6
"Perhaps, if he could just  keep Slughorn in a good mood .",6
"Thus far, however, we have done well.",6
"... Could you see what he pointed at when he said ‘that one’?” “No, he was behind that cabinet — ” “You two stay here,” whispered Hermione.",6
"...” Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid ’s hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled.",6
"Exhausted but delighted with his night’s work, Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next morning’s Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them).",6
Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently.,6
"Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?” “Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione.",6
"“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice.",6
"But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister.",6
"Several people gasped, including Hermione.",6
A part of him — the part closest to his throbbing right ear — was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off.,6
"“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?” “Definitely,” said Dumbledore.",6
Why?” “Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” asked Snape.,6
you know ... in love with Sirius?” Hermione stared at him.,6
"Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent.",6
"“Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi.",6
He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley.,6
"“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice.",6
"What d’you — ?” began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.",6
"""... not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother.",6
and — and — ” Leanne let out a wail of despair.,6
"Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything.",6
"“I think that will do for tonight, Harry,” said Dumbledore after a moment or two.",6
... You are Lucius’s old friend.,6
He smiled ruefully at the tarlike  substance in Ron’s cauldron.,6
Nothing else mattered to Harry just now.,6
Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him?,6
"Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention.",6
"A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock.",6
"...” “You think so?” Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure.",6
... ‘I can make them hurt if I want to.,6
Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters.,6
"“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely.",6
"“But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.” “Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now?",6
"...” And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put  Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.",6
Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope.,6
"What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?” “I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don’t want you butting in!” Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole.",6
"“It was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused — ” “Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!” “Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore.",6
"Tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta?",6
"“And if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.” Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor.",6
"Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this.",6
"The cases are completely — ” “But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupin’s robes and shaking them.",6
Could their friendship  survive it?,6
"“She gave him an easy save.”  “Rubbish,” said Harry coldly.",6
"“See, the rest o’ the tribe ... Aragog’s family ... they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill ... bit restive ...” “Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an undertone.",6
"Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful.",6
"He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.",6
"...”  “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron sharply.",6
It was his left arm.,6
"""... and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here.",6
"Then the lane  curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them.",6
"It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air.",6
“It was on my birthday!” he said.,6
"What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?” “Dumbledore,” said Harry.",6
"“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily.",6
"The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, “Enter.” Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp.",6
"There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy, and Harry stood, and Harry’s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest.",6
"Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water.",6
"We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then — ” Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream.",6
"Anyway, the rest of the team might’ve dealt with him before you get out of here, they’re not happy.",6
"Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.” “I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain himself.",6
"“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of the way for the Keepers I’ll hex you,” he bellowed.",6
"Well, let’s get going, then, George.” “What are you two up to?” asked Ron.",6
"Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats.",6
"They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.",6
"He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the entrance hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs.",6
"“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles.",6
"...  Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case ... Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled.",6
"“You don’t reckon ... he hasn’t found ... ?”  “Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said Harry, jumping to his feet.",6
"“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again ... one — two — three — ” But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened.",6
"“A very interesting question, Harry.",6
There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didn’t recoil.,6
Come.” Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff.,6
"The asylum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it?",6
“Is it the real Mark?,6
He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.,6
"Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad.",6
“She still hasn’t got over what happened .,6
"“Very well, Potter, here is your schedule.",6
"“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry.",6
"“I just thought — well, he’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.” “How old is this book, Harry?” “I dunno, I’ve never checked.” “Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin.",6
You told me you had to keep drinking.,6
"Generations of purebloods, wizards all — more than you can say, I don’t doubt!” And he spat on the floor at Ogden’s feet.",6
"Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, “It’s a  nice day.” Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry’s brain: She’s Ron’s sister.",6
"“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily.",6
Quick ... give it to me ...” “But what about the Half-Blood — ” “I’ll explain later!”  Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room.,6
"“You are the best in the year — I’d’ve told him so if he’d asked me!” Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying.",6
Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie’s substitute.,6
"Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself.",6
"“Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry.",6
"He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls.",6
"Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.",6
"“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, “I might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?” “Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice.",6
"Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities.",6
"“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once.",6
... You know how these spells come and go.,6
"Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man.",6
"He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.",6
"And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter.",6
"“Where is the party?” “Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering.",6
"Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.",6
"And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger.",6
The same is probably true of hundreds of people — ”  “ — that’s what I said — ” muttered Ron.,6
Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning.,6
“The curse didn’t even make it into the castle.,6
"“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening.",6
It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges.,6
"The bond between the two of you — ” “What do you want?” Harry repeated, coming to a halt.",6
I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood — ” “And did that work?” asked Dumbledore.,6
"Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.”  Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air.",6
"“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?” But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke.",6
"“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test.",6
Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing.,6
Harry wondered whether he was in pain.,6
This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.,6
Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler.,6
"He continued, “On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.” “Private — with you?” said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.",6
"The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question.",6
"This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain.",6
"“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden.",6
"Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix’s glowering face.",6
"“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grinning.",6
The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself.,6
"“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be  able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.” Harry groaned.",6
"...”  “We were in trouble, we were losing,” said Tonks in a low voice.",6
"“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole.",6
What would Ron and Hermione say about this?,6
"The top of the elf’s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah ’s chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.",6
"...” “Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry.",6
“Destination ... determination ... deliberation ...” she murmured.,6
I don’ know what I’ll do if he ... if he ... We’ve bin tergether so long.,6
“Harry?” said Hermione in an anxious voice.,6
"They’re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.” And she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.",6
Hagrid’s hand on his shoulder was trembling.,6
“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron through clenched teeth.,6
His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.,6
"They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other.",6
"“ — someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw — ” “Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy.",6
"Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower.",6
"What d’you reckon, Harry?” “I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said Harry.",6
"You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife.",6
"""... you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells.",6
"“If you think security’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and I’ll get your things myself — ” “No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George’s shop!” said Ron hastily.",6
"“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape.",6
"... Cornin’ ter see old  Aragog off, though, eh?",6
"“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken.",6
Professor Snape whom I need.,6
"It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry.",6
"I really don’t know where you get these brain waves, my boy .",6
"The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.",6
I’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before.,6
"“In any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone.",6
"“Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend!",6
"Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape ’s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.",6
He stuffed the Half-Blood Prince’s book behind the cage and slammed the door.,6
"“Come on, Harry, I’ll give you a tour.” Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.",6
"“Good luck.” “And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons.",6
"“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors.",6
"There were a few people out in the grounds ... and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle.",6
"“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.",6
"...” “I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry.",6
"“How do you feel?” Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed.",6
...” Nobody asked how Harry knew this.,6
"Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion.",6
"It was, Harry knew, the centaurs’ tribute: He saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees.",6
"“Here — let me show you — ” He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, “Protegol” His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk.",6
"“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously.",6
"He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather .",6
"Malfoy obviously hadn’t expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate.",6
"You must know this, Dumbledore.” “You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?” asked Dumbledore delicately.",6
"Now, how about Monday night, you can’t possibly want to practice in this weather.",6
"“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look carrying that down the street?’ ” said Hermione.",6
"Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realized what it meant — even Borgin didn’t know — I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one.” “Very good,” murmured Dumbledore.",6
"“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages.",6
"When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind.",6
"The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a  crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.",6
Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him.,6
“I’m really well!” she said happily.,6
"How d’you think I feel about that now?” “No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to check that they were not being overheard.",6
"He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight.",6
"“I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog’s Head ... or I appear to.",6
"He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead.",6
"“Now you can let me in.” Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn- rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak.",6
Tell the truth!” He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking.,6
"“I tell you what, Harry, I’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two.",6
"“What is it?”  “It’s ... him ...” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron.",6
"Over Dean’s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour.",6
I didn’t notice that they’d lit the lamps!,6
"“Same difference really ...” As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn ’s office once the teacher had had time to get back there.",6
"You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle — ” “They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my side, better people!” “Then why not confide in me, and I can — ” “I know what you’re up to!",6
"“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole.",6
"In the end, he managed to Apparate out, even though he’d never passed his test.",6
"“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts.",6
He was not the only one.,6
That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity?,6
"Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious.",6
"“ Quid agis?” he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside.",6
"“Out of bed so late, this’ll mean detention!” “No it won’, Filch,” said Hagrid shortly.",6
No sign of a struggle.,6
"Half a dozen boys were sitting around  Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens.",6
"It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s secrets.” “No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione.",6
"But on the other hand ...” He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle.",6
"“Listen, without the Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis.",6
"And if I meet Severus Snape along the way,” he added, “so much the better for me, so much the worse for him.” There was a long silence.",6
... Stay out of trouble.,6
"“And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?” “Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry.",6
He believed he was making himself invincible.,6
But this raised as many questions as it answered.,6
"The Heads of Houses moved among the students, marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments.",6
"Once the girl was out of earshot he said, “Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!” “Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore ’s long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.",6
"Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore ’s clenched hand.",6
Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer’s Stone?,6
"“No!” Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill’s bed, his hands over his face.",6
"He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond.",6
"No, listen to me!” he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting.",6
"“Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha.",6
"“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself.",6
"Said Mrs. Augusta Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good friend of Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and —  But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it.",6
“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly.,6
The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose.,6
"“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you or they’ll worry.",6
"There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy.",6
"“Good evening, Professor.” “Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump,” said Slughorn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary.",6
"Carry on.” Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.)",6
Harry and Neville caught each other’s eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.,6
"Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first.",6
"“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,” said Ron, returning to his copy of A Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.",6
"“We’re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like ...",6
"“Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said Hermione skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.",6
"... “R.A.B.,” whispered Ron, “but who was that?” “Dunno,” said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards.",6
"“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard.",6
This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror.,6
He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it.,6
"Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.",6
"“I know he believes you, but ...” “You think he is mistaken?",6
They’ve deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named.,6
"...” “You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage.",6
Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary.,6
"“Are you all right, dear?” “Oh yes,” said Voldemort quietly.",6
"“He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he — while he went to help fight the Death Eaters — ” She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled.",6
"...” She looked away from him, over the lake.",6
“Knew there was something ... ah well.,6
"“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry.",6
"Yes.” She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office.",6
"... “Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.",6
"“But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible — ” “I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,” said Dumbledore calmly.",6
"This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.” Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere.",6
"After you, Harry ...” Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again.",6
"“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus.",6
"The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon.",6
"Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them.",6
"“I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole — ” “ You considered Smith?” said Harry, revolted.",6
"“You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.” “Kreacher’s done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear — ” “Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated.",6
"“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,” croaked Kreacher at once.",6
"...” Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium.",6
"“We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?” “Were you?” said Harry, taken aback.",6
"The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.” “Glad to hear it,” said Harry.",6
"Death would be preferable.” But Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing.",6
“We need to penetrate the inner place.,6
"“I mean, it really does seem to be ... just a textbook.” “Good.",6
"It was a — a nasty killing, wasn’t it?",6
"“I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,” she said quickly.",6
"“You can keep it if you like, I’ve got a few of them.",6
"“Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him?",6
"“Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson.",6
“Tell him what has happened and bring him to me.,6
"Concentrating with all his might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy ’s  doing in here.",6
...” Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.,6
"“His mother or someone.” “All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione.",6
"“We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — this was before he became Minister, obviously — ” “Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?” beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out.",6
"No charge.” “I can’t do that!” said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.",6
"“So how was your Christmas?” “Oh, fine,” she shrugged.",6
"But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river.",6
"“I remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks like his papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny name, isn’t it?",6
"The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to water just looking at it.",6
"Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed  less likely to scorn a theory, however wild.",6
"They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!” Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe.",6
"Harry’s mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snape.",6
"“She still wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten!",6
"He remembered it and he went back for it!” “I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly.",6
"“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger.",6
"For a moment, Ron beamed at them.",6
"“Excellent, excellent.” These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon.",6
Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak.,6
But he took a risk and it paid off.” He heaved a sigh.,6
"“Ah, well ... you can’t evade me forever, Harry!” And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.",6
"“Yeah, I thought you’d say that.",6
"We’ve been terrified!” “I’ll tell you later,” said Harry curtly.",6
"Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him.",6
"It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history.",6
He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.,6
"“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna.",6
"I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer.",6
His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see.,6
"“I didn’t do anything,” said Harry in surprise.",6
“But the Ministry never attracted me as a career.,6
Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again.,6
"Of course,” she added broodingly, “that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.” Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, the dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward.",6
"But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water.",6
"Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.",6
"I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.” “That’s stupid,” said Ron.",6
Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary .,6
He was arguing with Crabbe just now.,6
"“I mean, it’s always bin a bit of a risk sendin’ a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn’ it?",6
“It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing — ” “Summons!,6
"“I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?” “No,” said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now.",6
“But Bill’s not that down-to-earth.,6
"“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna’s conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.",6
"“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly.",6
"Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: My Sweetheart “Nice,” he said.",6
“ — I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are.,6
"“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.” “Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.",6
"“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked Harry and Neville.",6
"“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round- faced boy struggling toward him.",6
"They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and — and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.” “Dumbledore might know something that’d work, though,” Ron said.",6
"Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry’s opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.",6
“I’ve told you a million times.,6
"Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, “Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” “Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time.",6
"... “Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly.",6
It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather.,6
"Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.",6
"meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas ... ah, well ...” He shrugged.",6
"A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth ... and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.” “Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them apart!” said Ron.",6
Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle.,6
"And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe.",6
“It’ll be warm.” They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop.,6
"“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore.",6
"As though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore shook his head.",6
"“It’s all my fault, all my fault,” he sobbed.",6
Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice.,6
"“Harry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right?",6
"“And now, Harry, on a closely related subject ...",6
The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.,6
"Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban.",6
"If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship.",6
"“Please close the door and sit down, Harry,” said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired.",6
It’s urgent.” “But of course.”  He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house.,6
“Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory.,6
"As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, “Severus, I’m sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you.",6
“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry.,6
Share it between yourselves and Ginny too.,6
"“Listen, no bloke in his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur’s around.",6
"He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain.",6
"“But she said you were just going for a drink, you’d be back.",6
"Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped  around the lamp squealing, “Stick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies — ” Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, “Langlockl” Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.",6
"If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.",6
"“In the air, everyone, let’s go.",6
"He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledore’s body.",6
"“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand.",6
"“Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.” Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose at once to  leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.",6
"Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze.",6
"...” And he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep.",6
Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.,6
"Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time.",6
When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione.,6
"Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud.",6
"Our information” — he glanced down at his scroll of parchment — “is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.” Morfin giggled.",6
"“Sooner you ask someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can — ”  But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.",6
"“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.",6
"Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”  He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful.",6
"I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.” Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron’s face, Harry went on, “I want to know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what he’s doing.",6
"“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded.",6
"“Tell me when you call trials!” “Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, “you don’t need to try out, I’ve watched you play for five years.",6
"We took away everything that might have been dangerous.” “I think you missed something,” said Harry stubbornly.",6
"Still looking into Harry’s eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand tip.",6
"The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air.",6
“It would be a very brave and noble thing to do.” Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on.,6
He had no idea what to say to her.,6
He had been afraid of that.,6
"Ron was in there ... and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew.",6
"“Just because I don’t do it in public — !” Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.",6
"I heard your parents wanted you to leave.” “I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said Parvati.",6
"... ‘Mudblood,’ he called her.",6
"An’ then he said summat abou’ Snape makin’ investigations in his House, in Slytherin.",6
Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position.,6
"Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them.",6
"A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen?",6
"What’s happened to him?” “Dragged off, by the look of his place.” “Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.",6
"...” “I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.",6
"He was not the only one: Many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.",6
"“You have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.” There was a pause.",6
"This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible.",6
"The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.",6
"“Oh, surprise me,” said Slughorn airily.",6
"“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron.",6
"“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.",6
"“Good to see you again.” The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all.",6
"“She could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn’t she?” “Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could.",6
"“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron.",6
"Your mother,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’s questioning look.",6
"The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle.",6
"Where did you get this anyway?” “The library,” said Hermione predictably.",6
"Making them float along, asleep, helpless.” Harry stared at her.",6
"“Greyback hadn’t transformed, so surely Bill won’t be a — a real — ?” He looked uncertainly at Lupin.",6
"“So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?” “Yes, I think so.” Harry did not say anything.",6
"Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.",6
"Her eyes, like her brother’s, stared in opposite directions.",6
"Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror?",6
"“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” said Snape.",6
"“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione.",6
"The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast.",6
"If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months.",6
"In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.",6
"“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his Keeper,” said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered.",6
“But whoever it was has had a narrow escape.,6
"“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic.",6
"“ ‘Darling,’ ” whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister.",6
"You have — inadvertently, I am sure — been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school.",6
"“What d’you mean, ‘no’?” “There is a new password,” she said.",6
“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store!,6
"There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen.",6
"“But you’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t you?” Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips.",6
"“It’s terrible,” growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase.",6
His seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s this past week.” Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table.,6
"All righ’, come in then, yeh ungrateful little ...” Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass.",6
"“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girls’ dormitory without another word.",6
“I mean ... with Snape ’s history ... of course people were bound to wonder .,6
“Seven of spades: an ill omen.,6
"“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!” “Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harry’s knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn.",6
"He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants.",6
He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row.,6
"On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.",6
"For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.",6
It won’t work ... and unless I do it soon ... he says he’ll kill me.,6
"He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly.",6
"“I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.” “Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles.",6
"I rather think an enchantment will have been  placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.” “But then — ?” “I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified.",6
"Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, / didn’t make up the name ‘Slug Club’ — ” “ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy.",6
The door swung shut behind her.,6
“We all know you can’t get enough of her.” This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s mother.,6
"“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred gloomily.",6
Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves.,6
"It was I who invented them — I, the Half-Blood Prince!",6
"“Here, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again.",6
Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me!,6
"...”  “Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go back — ?” “And get the book?",6
"“Blimey, they don’t look happy, do they?” “They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don’t look happy, didn’t you hear what happened to their little brother?” said Hermione.",6
"“Firs’ Katie, now Ron ...” “I can’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,” said George.",6
"...”  “Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly.",6
"In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.” “She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?” Dumbledore raised his eyebrows.",6
"It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground.",6
“You make sure you look after yourself and — ” The train was gathering speed.,6
Lucius was supposed to be in charge.,6
Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making.,6
"It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.",6
"“She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he’s not even here?” “I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively.",6
I don’t know whether Ron’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only just happened — but Arthur’s been promoted!” It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.,6
"“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty- five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk.",6
"And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks ’s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.",6
"You might have set a record, Potter.” The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late.",6
"A decision should not be made hastily.” “Hagrid, you haven’t said anything,” said Professor McGonagall.",6
"Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact.",6
“And what will become of those whom you command?,6
Ginny playing Seeker against Cho .,6
"I can just tell.” “The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,” said Hermione angrily.",6
"Now, why haven’t you applied to continue with Potions?",6
"“We don’t want it, you take it, who knows what you’re going to be facing?” “I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore,” said Harry.",6
"“But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back — ” “Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,” said Hermione.",6
"We’ve had time, haven’t we?",6
"“Ah ... Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched.",6
"“Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,” said Twycross.",6
He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next.,6
"Harry could think of nothing to say, except, “Kreacher, shut up!” It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke.",6
Harry knew what was on her mind at once.,6
"“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but — ”  “Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled Bellatrix.",6
"No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession.",6
"“I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions.” “Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” said Dumbledore.",6
"I should have realized you wouldn’t have asked me to do it if it wasn’t really important.” “Thank you for saying that, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly.",6
... He’s just like Voldemort.,6
"“Did you hear, there’s supposed to be a vampire coming?” “Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna.",6
"“Yes, of course,” said Harry, slightly nonplussed.",6
"Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was.",6
...” “Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” asked Harry.,6
"“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted.",6
"...” “What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent.",6
"The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted, “Expelliarmus\” Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall,  propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak.",6
"Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp, and his body became limp and still.",6
In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office.,6
"Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward  Wilkie Twycross and his three D’s, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead.",6
But he is determined that Draco should try first.,6
My father had offended him.,6
"They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter.",6
"“And, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey — ” “ — because she was a house-elf,” said Harry.",6
"“It’s her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry’s bed.",6
"“What a pleasant surprise!” “Severus,” she said in a strained whisper.",6
"How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!”  ‘Tm sorry, sir,” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.",6
"“I don’t reckon they’ll find you till the train’s back in London,” he said quietly.",6
"“No, I suppose that’s true.",6
"You know full well I never listened ...” “No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!” said Hermione.",6
"Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence.",6
"“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth.",6
“I do love knitting patterns.,6
"He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.",6
“Harry?” They looked at each other for a moment.,6
"Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.” “And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?” “Never,” said Dumbledore.",6
"“Master called me?” croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.",6
"“We thought — ” Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.",6
There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.,6
I can make them hurt if I want to.”  His legs were trembling.,6
“Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.” Harry couldn’t believe it.,6
"“You don’t know what I’ve done!” “Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly.",6
"“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry.",6
"...”  “He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy quickly.",6
"Apparently he’s gone away again.” “Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor.",6
“A bit lonely without the D.A.,6
"“Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace,” said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute.",6
"“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape coldly.",6
"“Harry, I passed!” “Well done!” he said.",6
"“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until ... well ...” Hagrid ’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets.",6
"“Pick-me-up, that’s what he needs,” Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks.",6
"Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn’t realized what he  was doing, he was really sorry he’d done it, sorry that they were dead.” They all stared at him.",6
Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed.,6
"“It’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she’s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after what happened at the Ministry.” Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.",6
And we’re going to be getting free time this year.,6
"Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, “Was my father a wizard?",6
"“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, “I wanted to ask you something.” “Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away.",6
"Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.",6
The Potions master seemed unable to look away.,6
"“If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey.",6
"“But what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?” Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape.",6
"He had known all along that he wouldn’t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E. It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything else he would like to be.",6
"“Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest “But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry “Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.” The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.",6
"“But mate, you’re going to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else, even Godric’s Hollow.” “Why?” “Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?” Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.",6
“Don’t touch if!” He crouched down.,6
"Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more.",6
"How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward.",6
Hardly anyone knew of it at the time — I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided — but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.” “He wanted to stay here?,6
"“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore.",6
"What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron.",6
"Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned “For Enemies,” that he had marked a few weeks  previously.",6
"Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledore’s lined face.",6
"“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman.",6
"Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.” Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.",6
"Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have  exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination.",6
"“Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries — ” “It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge.",6
"“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘home.’ However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom.",6
you have already destroyed one of them.,6
Harry was  pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.,6
"A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.” Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore’s hat.",6
We turn left again.” The church clock chimed midnight behind them.,6
"However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.” “I understand,” said Harry quickly.",6
“You kept that quiet!” said Ron.,6
"“I’ve seen you with Phlegm, hoping shell kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it’s pathetic!",6
Told them to help themselves!,6
“Did she say anything before she died?” asked Dumbledore.,6
"Terrible ... terrible ...”  He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs.",6
"I thought I knew him!” But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas.",6
"Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.",6
I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion.,6
“I shall know whether it has been done.,6
Bit dusty.” He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed.,6
"“He’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught.” “We’ve been down to see him by night before,” said Harry.",6
Harry merely looked at Slughorn.,6
Can’t move like I used to.,6
"“Who wants eggnog?”  “What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked Lupin, as Mr. Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.",6
"Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore what’s going on, he’s the only one who scares Mundungus.” “Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down.",6
Are you still with us?” asked Hermione.,6
“Severus ... please ...” Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.,6
want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her ... No ... he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling.,6
“Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying.,6
"Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.",6
"Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying “I told you so,” which he had done several times to Ron already.",6
The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows.,6
"Coming nearer all the time ...” “Right,” said Harry again.",6
"“Snape killed ... Dumbledore.” Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.",6
"I quite understand that your father’s capture and imprisonment has upset you, but — ” Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant corner, and out of sight.",6
"“If you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it.",6
"After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly.",7
"Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go.",7
"“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently.",7
"But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus.",7
She was still white with dust.,7
“Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s treasures.,7
"“Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!” They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.",7
"“The Ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.” “It’s fine, I understand,” said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks.",7
"One of them was definitely part troll, the smell off him.",7
"“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?” “Someone had searched before me,” said Harry.",7
Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him?,7
"“Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think we’d better do it, Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children and — why are you so wet?” “Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself.",7
"“We did desire it — we do.” To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake.",7
The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them: All was silent.,7
“Go abroad if you can.,7
“I thought ... you were going ... to keep her ... safe.,7
"... Well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.” Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked.",7
"“I don’t understand,” she whispered.",7
"“We can’t just go, we haven’t got a plan, we need to — ” “We need to get going,” said Harry firmly.",7
"I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists.",7
"“Oh, Harry ...” “And there’s this too.” He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.",7
Then a voice yelled: “HARRY!,7
"He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.",7
"If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.” “Tell him what?” Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.",7
"If that is Harry Potter, he will know.” The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room.",7
"All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part!",7
"“You, Barny — you know this man Lovegood veil?” “No, I only met him today.",7
"“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice.",7
"They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one.",7
"“Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d’yeh remember it?” “Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him.",7
"“You’re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?” “Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk.",7
"“You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.” “So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks.",7
"The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes.",7
“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord.,7
"Once past the gate, Griphook spoke.",7
Ron kicked a chair leg.,7
"Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.",7
And is it working well?,7
"He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow.",7
"You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible.",7
"Well, Voldemort did ... and so did Sirius.” Harry had no retort.",7
“I don’t need you to tell me that.,7
"In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father.",7
"“Yes, he is, Ron, please don’t start that again!” “Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the horizon.",7
"“Teddy would really be part of the family then!” “He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry.",7
"He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscley arms.",7
"“And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!”  “Really, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether “For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there.",7
... And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak.,7
"I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.”  Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.",7
"“We’ll go straight down, Mafalda, you’ll find everything you need in the courtroom.",7
"Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket!",7
"“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him.",7
"“Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take the risk.” Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.",7
He’s not coming.” “And he was sure he’d come!,7
The previous master will never have been defeated.,7
But what was ‘the close’?,7
"“Blimey, Harry, after all we wen’ through ter get you here?” “Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, hoisting himself up on his cushions.",7
"“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.” “How?” asked Harry.",7
"“You aren’t serious, Harry?” “I am,” said Harry.",7
"A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, domed glass ceiling.",7
"It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left — ” “This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right?",7
There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister.,7
“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophilius.,7
— to do with the Hallows!” “Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron.,7
"“You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to Hermione.",7
"Word was you’d been caught.” “I was,” said Dirk.",7
"“Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter.",7
"The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself.",7
"She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun.",7
... Be a man ... try ...,7
She stopped and looked back.,7
"He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck.",7
Harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing.,7
"“I’ll go first, shall I?” And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave.",7
"The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two.",7
"There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel- bright across the square.",7
"We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we?",7
"Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise — ” “She never pretended anything of the sort!",7
"“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid.",7
"...” “And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him.",7
“Delicious girl ... What a treat ...,7
“What else could I do with it?” Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions.,7
"Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.",7
"“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen.",7
"“It’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.” He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag.",7
Harry and the barman looked at each other.,7
The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back.,7
But I think you know my Luna?” he added to Ron.,7
"He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him.",7
"That they were the original owners of the Hallows!” With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase.",7
"“I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald ’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along!",7
"I always think wands require a little breaking in, don’t you?” Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.",7
"... Shall I serve dinner now?” They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of “Happy Birthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up.",7
"“May I sit down?” “Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice.",7
"Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic.",7
"Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed.",7
"“We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort  of the leaders.",7
"And don’t let James wind you up.” “What if I’m in Slytherin?” The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.",7
This struck Harry as slightly odd.,7
The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again.,7
"I know I was a — a — ” He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him.",7
"Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall.",7
"Now he came to think about it, he had not yet tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand.",7
"The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.",7
"“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named while you search for this — this object.” “Is that possible?” “I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are rather good at magic, you know.",7
He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized.,7
"“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout with his wand-free hand.",7
I went through it and met Aberforth.,7
"Finally Bill said, “All right.",7
"“He wants a kip, and his bar’s turned into a railway station.” Harry’s mouth fell open.",7
"He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury.",7
"All of their faces were turned toward him, looking puzzled.",7
"Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make themselves impressive — until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.” Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius.",7
"and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow.",7
Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing.,7
"“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow.” Dumbledore smiled at Harry.",7
"Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said.",7
It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.,7
"There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All righ’, Harry?",7
"Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait.",7
"He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind.",7
"“Ron — ?” The sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream.",7
Harry hurried to help her.,7
And he drank — all the potion — and Kreacher swapped the lockets — and watched ... as Master Regulus .,7
"As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.",7
Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry.,7
"“Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur.",7
"""... thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying.",7
“Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation.,7
“Grab hold and make it tight.,7
"It’s my fault, it’s all my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry.” “It’s not your fault.",7
"Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out.",7
"If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences.",7
"It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday.",7
"The dementors were gliding up and down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse.",7
He had spotted the thing that was making the noises.,7
"Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close.",7
Why did the young thief look familiar?,7
"The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE and captioned with the reward money.",7
"He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.” “And will it?” “The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,” said Ollivander, “but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit ... formidable.” Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he liked Ollivander.",7
You were looking into Vol — ” “Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from the depths of the tent.,7
The only potentially useful thing he could see here was  possible information on Dumbledore.,7
"“Well,” he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, “well, I’ll just borrow yours for now, then.",7
The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two.,7
“Where Ve they gone?” “I don’t know!” But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s the real one!”; how had he known?,7
"“Here, have a sweet.” “Eh?",7
"It looks unsafe, it might — oh, Harry, look!”  His touch on the gate seemed to have done it.",7
"Didn’t Aberforth break Albus ’s nose halfway through the service?” If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now.",7
"He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care.",7
"“He always did himself well, Lucius.",7
You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!”  “No — not sneaking — ” Now Lily was on the defensive.,7
His eyes had slid from Harry’s face to something else.,7
"I don’t mean holding it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching it,” she added before Ron could speak.",7
"The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape.",7
"“See you in a bit.” He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected places.",7
"“He only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!” “Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’ ” said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.",7
"... Harry, you’d better take the Invisibility Cloak.",7
He must try that in the morning.,7
"“I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.”  “No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once.",7
He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of — how Death Eaters had found them within minutes.,7
"After a while, Ron whispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?” “No ... it must’ve been something small.” “Harry?” The wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed.",7
"He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family.",7
"Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me.",7
It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s brain and obliterated his sense of caution — that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials.,7
“You told him about the twin cores?,7
Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.,7
"“I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.”  Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket.",7
“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied.,7
"“Harry, come back in the house,” Hermione whispered.",7
"One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.",7
"“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?” “It — it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation.",7
"This way, please ...” And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall.",7
"The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely.",7
"We are.” The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.",7
"THE PRINCE’S TALE Harry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room.",7
“Why didn’t I ask him?,7
I took it from its previous master.,7
I wish / were dead.,7
When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress?,7
Hermione shot him a look of annoyance.,7
“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback.,7
“ ‘And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like.,7
"He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke.",7
"“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered.",7
"“Well, more of a crown, really.” Ron caught Harry’s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.",7
We haven’t got wands yet.,7
"“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!” “Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s destroyed.” “And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?” asked Ron.",7
"“Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?” “Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow.",7
"“Leave the lights on,” Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it.",7
"“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!” Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms.",7
"I don’t understand — ” But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair.",7
He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary.,7
"Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death’s.",7
"“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow.",7
"“Well, I’ve had a change of heart.",7
"All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert ...",7
Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar.,7
This is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures.,7
"That’s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me — or you, because unfortunately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you.",7
"And while we are talking about services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?” Snape looked angry, mutinous.",7
The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.,7
"“They look like they might be breaching the north battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own!” “Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him.",7
"""... and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like a hippo’s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy.",7
He was sure that Scrimgeour was right.,7
“She’ll be at her parents’ house.” There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost cold.,7
"BATHILDA’S SECRET “Harry, stop.” “What’s wrong?” They had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott.",7
"He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left him.",7
There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze.,7
... Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower.,7
"He  had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it — particularly in light of his immediate plans — this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education.",7
"He recognized one as part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual.",7
Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing.,7
"“You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?” “It was a rumor,” whispered Ollivander.",7
Your scar — it wasn’t supposed to do this anymore!,7
"Partly to change the subject, Harry said, “Speaking of  Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?” “Oh yeah,” said Ron at once, “people are talking about it quite a lot.",7
“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult.,7
"“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick.",7
"“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione.",7
"There’s writing on it, quick, look!” He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement.",7
Every pore of his body screamed in protest: The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water.,7
"Saving my life.” “That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled.",7
"At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand.",7
"Who are you, girly?” “Penelope Clearwater,” said Hermione.",7
"“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George.",7
"“No difference,” said Voldemort again.",7
"Very, very few wizards believe.",7
There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker.,7
“Diffindo.” It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water.,7
"“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription.",7
"She thought I’d have to Confund the examiner.” “No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.” “As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus ’s trunk and owl onto the train.",7
Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him.,7
"“Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ave ’ad champagne.” From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.",7
Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.,7
"“I knew my brother, Potter.",7
"Who’s your father?” “He works at the Ministry,” Harry lied.",7
He could also see the half-healed puncture marks to his forearm.,7
"Harry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut.",7
Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?” “I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus.,7
“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?” “T-took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole.,7
“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly.,7
Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful.,7
He also  had a beard.,7
"Having misunderstood Fred’s directions he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.",7
But he did all right for a few weeks .,7
"“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively.",7
"“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, “Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important.",7
"“The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind.",7
“More for any who want them!,7
"“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said Hermione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it.",7
"There was another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished.",7
He glanced at Hermione for assistance.,7
"It is real, isn’t it?” “It’s real for us,” said Snape.",7
"They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s about to break and they know the rough position of the place.",7
"He didn’t like that,” said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses: They shone white and blind again.",7
“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding.,7
"She had made her “g”s the same way he did: He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil.",7
"“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly.",7
"He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one last, but he could still be there within hours — ” “Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too.",7
"“What — how dare — what are you — ?” “I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a necessary precaution!” “Remove this foul addition at once!",7
"Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy — But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it?",7
"I packed your rucksack this  morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here.",7
"“ — that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever visited Gringotts?” said Griphook.",7
"They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to him.",7
"He does not love.” “But you expected him to go after the wand?” “I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton.",7
I may be able to sleep at last.,7
"“Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him now.",7
"If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened!",7
"He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm.",7
Harry stopped in the doorway.,7
Hermione took it and read it while Harry watched her.,7
"Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated.",7
He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place.,7
The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink.,7
"It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly.",7
"After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf.",7
"“You-Know-Who’s mind, then!” “I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said.",7
"“Somewhere ... somewhere ...” Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room.",7
“What do you mean?” he asked Muriel.,7
"No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements.",7
And we’ve done it on this cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here.,7
“Bill and Fleur’s new place.,7
"The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools, serving the first customers of the day.",7
"“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?” Snape asked abruptly.",7
"Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!” “There!” Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor.",7
"He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.",7
"Can you believe that?” The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation.",7
"She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us.",7
"Lovegood — what’s that?” She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been  mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room.",7
"“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.",7
"“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening.",7
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran.",7
"He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.",7
Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours!,7
I thought you would ... one day.,7
"Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back on it.",7
"“It’s Potter, I tell you, it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius.",7
Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry panted.,7
Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look.,7
"... And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection.",7
"His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned.",7
"Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure) , there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.",7
Harry’s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise.,7
“All right if we join you?” asked Ron.,7
"It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape.",7
"“Did I mention I’m resigning?” “You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells.",7
"“I don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?” he asked Hermione.",7
"“Nobody ever goes in there.”  “But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?” “Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her.",7
But I’m going to use it.” “Dumbledore — ” “Forget Dumbledore.,7
"“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said.",7
"“ ‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.” Snape made a small, disparaging noise.",7
"“And what gave you that impression?” Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin.",7
"Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents’ deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible.",7
Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform.,7
"“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around.",7
"If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.” There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on.",7
All movements are being monitored.,7
"Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name amongst the trees.",7
‘Parents’ professions: greengrocers.’ ” Yaxley laughed jeeringly.,7
"“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder’s object, to make into another Horcrux?” “Yeah,” said Harry.",7
"“It’s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?” “Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill- disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, “so that must mean — ” “ ‘Must mean?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity.",7
It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge.,7
Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend.,7
“She’ll be all right.” Harry looked back down at Dobby.,7
"It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself.",7
"“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” says Skeeter.",7
"“Thank you, Severus ...” The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.",7
"“More than the two that attacked us, you mean?",7
"D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?” “Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry’s face.",7
He’s gone and he’s not coming back.,7
"“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry said quickly.",7
"“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, “Polyjuice Potion ... Invisibility Cloak ... Decoy Detonators ... You should each take a couple just in case.",7
"The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.",7
"Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition: We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!",7
"He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.",7
"Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar.",7
“What d’you mean?” Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry.,7
"“Harry, here!” Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in his chest.",7
He was saving his neck and his friends’ too!,7
"He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, “I don’t understand.” “What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at her son.",7
He twiddled his thumbs together.,7
"The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready.",7
"“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?” asked Scrimgeour.",7
"“What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?”  “Stupefyl” she screamed.",7
"He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the  graveyard was leafless and frozen.",7
"“ ‘That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed.",7
"He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw.",7
"The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him.",7
“He’s lost — ” But the end of Mrs. Weasley ’s sentence was drowned in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them.,7
"“But it didn’t work,” Harry went on.",7
"Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.",7
Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides.,7
"Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.",7
“You did!” She was backing away from him.,7
It isn’t the real sword!,7
"“Maybe they’ll cover up — ”  The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke.",7
"Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.",7
"A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe.",7
"“Well, are we all packed and ready to go?” None of them answered him.",7
"“He tortured me, you must understand that!",7
They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back.,7
Oh yeah — ” He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up.,7
"“I’m sorry, Dad,” Percy said.",7
"It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying.",7
"Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.” Harry thought.",7
"“Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run over by the bride.” Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George.",7
"He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist ; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician.",7
"“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.",7
"After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione ’s feelings.",7
Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily.,7
"CRUCIO\” Hermione ’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore’s Snitch and  shook it, hoping for he did not know what — nothing happened — he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless — the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue — Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror.",7
"Regulus was trying to protect them all.” “Sirius — ” “Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no good looking like that, you know it’s true.",7
"“You need to find out where Voldemort is, because hell have the snake with him, won’t he?",7
"There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden- cased wireless.",7
"Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them.",7
“There are pictures of them inside.,7
"We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father!” Hermione shrieked.",7
"The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope.",7
“Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death.,7
"There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids.",7
"As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited.",7
"“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice.",7
"“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron.",7
"“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless.",7
"However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly.",7
“You’re all in danger while I’m here.,7
"Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of three .",7
"“Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?” “I don’t know,” said Harry.",7
"A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his  foot.",7
Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding?,7
"Lucius, Narcissa, Draco, and Greyback wheeled about; Harry yelled, “Stupefy\” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth.",7
"They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold.",7
"Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet.",7
"He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him.",7
One fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together.,7
"... Stupid idea, he told himself, don’t think that.",7
"... Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would go first.",7
You have lost half of your fighters.,7
"The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance.",7
Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face.,7
Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan.,7
"“Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?” “If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,” replied Griphook.",7
GODRIC’S HOLLOW When Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened.,7
The portraits that hung all around the  walls were empty.,7
"Three o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests.",7
"As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice, “Ron and Tonks should be back by now.",7
"They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could.",7
"Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling.",7
"There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent.",7
"The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds.",7
"He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione’s wand.",7
"I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you.” “Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn’t we?” “What happened, Harry?",7
"Ollivander,” said Harry, “you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?” Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler.",7
"Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape ’s figure to disappear.",7
"...” “Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s eyes.",7
"Why, then, had she led him to this spot?",7
"“Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot.",7
"This is a wizards’ war.” “How come you’re in hiding, then?”  “I deemed it prudent,” said the deeper-voiced goblin.",7
"“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return.",7
"He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she had sensed  someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back.",7
"Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort.",7
"“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made to repeat his spell.",7
They had also explained that they would not be returning.,7
"First time they’ve ever been top in anything, I expect.",7
"He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead.",7
"“It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore’s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path!",7
"“Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it?",7
“We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport.,7
Harry met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey.,7
"Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from behind a cloud.",7
"“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he said.",7
"The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road.",7
"When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.",7
"Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.",7
"He took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved.",7
"“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?” And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.",7
"He stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal  measure through his veins.",7
"“We make it ourselves.” As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here.",7
... And the scene dissolved once more.,7
"Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of  the people to whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become a Secret- Keeper in turn.",7
He knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs.,7
"“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes ...” said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging.",7
"“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill.",7
There’s something weird about that Lupin.,7
"“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,” said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling.",7
"I do not want to spill magical blood.” There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.",7
"“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast.",7
... It’s him ... it’s the real one.,7
"""... lucky that Ginny’s on holiday.",7
"And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left.",7
Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows.,7
"“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back.",7
He gave the wall a little push.,7
He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him.,7
"It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine.",7
"And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him — ” “The Prophet?” scoffed Ted.",7
“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.,7
"“What were you thinking, coming here?” “Thank you,” said Harry.",7
"“I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t — ” “Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you?",7
“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours.,7
"All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist.",7
“Maybe I’ll break the tradition.,7
"“Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.” “What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling.",7
Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole.,7
Master Regulus always liked Kreacher.,7
"He forced himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny’s.",7
"Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.",7
"I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think.",7
"“Light your wands, can’t you?",7
"His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then — But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.",7
I overpowered Draco weeks ago.,7
"I thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight, I thought — ” “They knew,” said Harry.",7
"Painstakingly he recounted what  he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.",7
"Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.",7
I’ll keep my word.” “But that could be years!” said Hermione.,7
"But never — never tell, Dumbledore!",7
"“Do not pity the dead, Harry.",7
"Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?",7
"After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.",7
"Snape hated it.” “You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.",7
"You’ve been ... Well, you haven’t been quite ...” There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face.",7
He had never imagined that there would be a statue.,7
"“Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you’ve got to.",7
"“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and  pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall.",7
"in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and  strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together.",7
“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour.,7
"Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.",7
"She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy.",7
"He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out.",7
"“Ah, Mafalda!” said Umbridge, looking at Hermione.",7
"The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above.",7
"His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.",7
"The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.’  “You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing the book, “because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century.",7
"With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up.",7
"“I beg your pardon?” “He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!” said Harry.",7
"“Here ... we ... are ...” she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag.",7
"You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.” “She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George.",7
"“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug.",7
"“It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.” “Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard’s bag, “but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention.",7
"Did you steal it back?” There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face.",7
He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself.,7
"I think it should just be me and Harry.” “Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione.",7
"“No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him.",7
"“I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books.",7
"“The man who taught me to fight dementors — a coward.” Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around the door.",7
"“Harry, they’re here ... right here.” And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.",7
"“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship.",7
You’ve still got the Trace on you.,7
The smell of the forest filled his nostrils.,7
"A symbol that links  Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow?",7
Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.” “ ‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron.,7
Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault.,7
"We don’t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back.",7
"His hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand.",7
"The wandless Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came.",7
He laughed before casting the curse.,7
"Who — ?” She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet.",7
"...” “We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder.",7
"!” Something huge and horned erupted from the wand: Head down, it charged toward the High Street and out of sight.",7
"Miss Delacour — ” “I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill.",7
“You want us to leave?” he asked.,7
"Dad always says she’ll have written them out of her will — like they care, they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re going.",7
"He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him.",7
“Don’t you start on her!” snarled Ron.,7
"Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be quite so quick to lower your defenses.” They ran down the stairs toward him.",7
He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid.,7
"“You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel.",7
"“There’s something we’d like to ask you.” “I ... I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius.",7
There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand.,7
"“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, “how’s this?",7
“How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?” “Everything — everything I heard!” said Snape.,7
"The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards.",7
"He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case.",7
He took a deep breath.,7
It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic.,7
"The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement.",7
"“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower.",7
The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.,7
"As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols.",7
"“Never mind,” he said gruffly.",7
"“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring of mirth.",7
Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots.,7
A moment later they heard the front door slam.,7
"Who’s — ?” “Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley.",7
"This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf ... “There was a b-basin full of potion on the island.",7
I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it.,7
Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent.,7
You saved our lives.”  The barman grunted.,7
“They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook.,7
He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them.,7
Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family.,7
"“But you’re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.” “Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?” Snape hesitated.",7
"“And do as you’re told.” Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.",7
And you think you’ll get your girl back like this?” “I swear ...,7
"“What the — ?” “Harry, yer here!",7
"“Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?” “Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.” “You mean he was weak!” screamed Voldemort.",7
“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry.,7
"“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on.",7
"Here — ” And with a movement like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window.",7
"Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.",7
"Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.",7
"Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s  ministrations, George’s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins’ many jokes about it.",7
"“Harry Potter,” he said very softly.",7
"Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it.",7
I can’t walk into Herbology and give him love.,7
"“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.",7
"Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.” “You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and the elf bowed low.",7
"Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf’s heaving chest.",7
"He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect.",7
"You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait.",7
"“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best- laid plans.",7
"The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione’s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold.",7
"“There’s someone up there all right, Selwyn,” said the second man sharply.",7
“But I should have died — I didn’t defend myself!,7
"... Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present: He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him.",7
"At last he said, “Very well.",7
"“Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!” “No, he was cleverer than you,” said Harry, “a better wizard, a better man.” “I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!” “You thought you did,” said Harry, “but you were wrong.” For the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one.",7
"“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last.",7
"Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent.",7
Harry had a sudden inspiration.,7
"“Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there.",7
Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore’s willingness to trust people.,7
"He will come.” “But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself — ” “My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear.",7
"Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate.",7
"The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice asked, “Severus Snape ?” Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand.",7
"At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must.",7
"“ ‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school.",7
"He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself.",7
"The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed.",7
"It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him.",7
"His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.",7
"... Harry, not Voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake.",7
"He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk.",7
"“How are you today?” “Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast.",7
“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted.,7
That is Grindelvald’s sign.” “Grindelwald .,7
"Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her  enchanted cage.",7
"That silly girl acted most unwisely there — ” “Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly.",7
He moved down the steps and out into the darkness.,7
"“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.",7
"He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating.",7
"I’m sure this is important, Harry!” Harry did not answer immediately.",7
"Harry was determined never to mention his  name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying.",7
"Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.",7
"Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind.",7
"She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.",7
"They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived.",7
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.” “Was?” repeated Harry.,7
Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside.,7
"... To tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn’t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?",7
Harry’s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it.,7
... You don’t mean he’s at Grimmauld Place?,7
"“Millamant’s Magic Marquees ... they’re very good, Bill’s escorting them.",7
He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself.,7
"“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego\” They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway.",7
"Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall.",7
I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place?” Hermione took a deep breath.,7
"Doge banged him on the back as Harry  coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes.",7
"... “Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said Harry.",7
"Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.",7
... How much more had he known?,7
"Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf’s bare feet.",7
At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead.,7
All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh.,7
I’m a Mudblood!” “Don’t call yourself — ” Ron muttered.,7
“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You- Know-Who doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight.,7
"A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner.",7
...” The elf quaked from head to foot.,7
"“But I’ve never done a Memory Charm.” “Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.” She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov’s forehead and said, “Obliviate.” At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy.",7
"“While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week.",7
"“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them.",7
"Remus, he can — ” “Fly,” supplied Harry.",7
"The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.",7
"“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice.",7
"“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the hill.",7
"A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead.",7
"Why?” Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor.",7
"“Look at the signature, Harry!” He obeyed.",7
"I think you’ve been up to something.” “You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven’t heard anything.” “It’s been ... well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke.",7
"“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two.",7
"They’ve fought dirty too.” “But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?” There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem.",7
"I was delirious, no doubt.",7
"How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest?",7
What has he done with them?,7
Tell me whether he is dead.” Harry did not know who had been sent to verify.,7
"Nevertheless, Charlie’s arrival came as a relief to Harry.",7
He let his gaze drift over his surroundings.,7
"We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?” “Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but that’s not what we came back for.",7
"Where?” “We found it — we found it — PLEASE!” Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry’s wrist.",7
"“Just — just to be clear,” he said.",7
"Here, he’s pretty tall, you’ll need bigger robes.",7
"The lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.",7
They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church.,7
"The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur.",7
"“It will expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.” They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the din.",7
"Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.",7
"“Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward.",7
"They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills.",7
“Why is that?” Hermione laughed derisively.,7
“Deprimo\” She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor.,7
“Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked.,7
"Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s position.” “All the same, try.",7
"“Oh — oh yeah.” He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of its pocket.",7
“Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin’s arms.,7
It might have belonged to Ravenclaw.,7
"“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,” he told Ron as he ate, “more than usual.",7
"“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet.",7
"The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.",7
"“There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage.",7
"A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee.",7
"NO!” He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby.",7
"You hurt her!” “No — no I didn’t!” But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused.",7
"“Not according to you, anyway.”  There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads.",7
Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for.,7
"The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter!",7
"never bothered to say And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common.",7
He was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken.,7
"We have a very serious problem!” She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt.",7
"He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape.",7
I dunno what they’re like in the original versions.”  “But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?” Something creaked downstairs.,7
"“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed.",7
"“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,” Bill went on.",7
"The one thing he had dreaded — but it could not be true, he could not see how ...",7
"Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors.",7
But they might give her back to me if I — if I — ” “Hand over Harry?” Hermione finished for him.,7
"They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.",7
He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet.,7
"As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries.",7
"“Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won’t you?” As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry’s forehead.",7
Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met?,7
Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup.,7
"At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers.",7
"It had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court.",7
"“We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.” Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration.",7
"“I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione.",7
“We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.” His insides clenched like a fist.,7
"They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts.",7
Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved.,7
"“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited.",7
"Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous — I don’t know where you got it “I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack.",7
"Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.",7
Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk.,7
"Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him.",7
At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort.,7
"One — two — three — ” They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them.",7
“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed.,7
"Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm.",7
The recitation of these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge.,7
"Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak, they crept toward the grimy window and looked down.",7
Where did it come from?,7
"ANSWER ME!” Amyous bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open.",7
"“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.” There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.",7
"If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool.",7
"The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone.",7
“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?” “That is correct.” Her tone was not encouraging.,7
Hermione was lying at Bellatrix’s feet.,7
"“You can have me, keep me!”  Bellatrix hit him across the face; the blow echoed around the room.",7
I won the wand.” Another silence.,7
“Hold tight ... any second Xenophilius’s paper- white face appeared over the top of the sideboard.,7
"Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no idea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs.",7
"“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this Lord Thing — ”  “ — Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through this about a hundred times already.",7
"Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous.",7
"Didn’t Doge understand Harry’s need to be sure, to know everything?",7
"And don’t expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me even though I don’t trust you!",7
"“I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback.",7
"He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms.",7
“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing!,7
“But I was happier with mine.,7
"“Kill me, then!” demanded the old man.",7
Part of the banisters had been blown away.,7
"It was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.",7
Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice.,7
“And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember.,7
"“I mean, the Weasleys don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?” “They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,” said Griphook.",7
Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must not know that you give it!,7
"“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione, indignant.",7
He was sure she was remembering them too.,7
"“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking shocked.",7
"You’ve got to give them credit, it makes sense.",7
"Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, “ Tergeo .” The wand siphoned off most of the grease.",7
Who do you want to talk to first?” Harry hesitated.,7
"“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s departure from his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore.",7
"“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry.",7
There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious.,7
"He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it.",7
"He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness.",7
"“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get out.",7
"“Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold?",7
"“You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child?",7
My wand?” Some of the throng sniggered.,7
"“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry.",7
And then he told me to go away.,7
"...” “You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, “if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter.",7
“With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I’d have expected him to be caught by now.,7
"“It is I, Remus John Lupin!” called a voice over the howling wind.",7
"“Do you feel all — all right?” “Yes,” he lied.",7
"“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,” Harry began.",7
"His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy.",7
"He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own.",7
They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment’s thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate.,7
Yaxley looked down at his watch.,7
"“I mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can’t.” There was silence as Harry digested this.",7
"“Why aren’t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?” “They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley.",7
“So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him.,7
"Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions about burying the elf.",7
"“Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!”  “You’re the one who needs sleep.",7
And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.” Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room.,7
"Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.” “Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry.",7
"“Yes, we were just discussing — ” “You there!",7
"“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment.",7
"“Answer me!” “A — a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?” Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.",7
"“So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?” “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them.",7
"They live down Spinner’s End by the river,” she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation.",7
"Hermione didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you?",7
“I — I’ve already told you.,7
"He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita’s invention.",7
"And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?” Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips.",7
"They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar.",7
"Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but — oh, it’s all nonsense.",7
"There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.",7
"He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling.",7
"I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.” “Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,” said Hermione.",7
"“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you.",7
“My kind don’t usually breed!,7
"She’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.”  “I hope you’re right,” said Hermione.",7
"“It’s time to act.” He could tell from Ron’s and Hermione’s faces that they were scared; he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.",7
"... “The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden.",7
"“Must’ve dozed off, sorry.” “I know it was your scar!",7
"We’ve been over and over this, I mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t even bothering to tell us — ” “Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing — ” “You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of — ” “I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry.",7
"“In that magazine of yours?” Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.",7
"“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.” “Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?” “He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.” “And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?” Snape gave a stiff nod.",7
"Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him.",7
"“That’s got to be Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that?",7
"Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch.",7
"For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.",7
“And you’d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it.,7
"It’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake, so the light’s all green.” There was a short pause.",7
"He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore ’s crooked- P a g e | 769 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling nosed profile.",7
"He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized.",7
"“ You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you — ” “Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands.",7
"Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.",7
"There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents’ house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.",7
There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.,7
"“Well ... er ... thanks, Dudley.”  Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.” “Not really,” said Harry.",7
"“Well, of course.” “But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, “Mr.",7
"“Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in.",7
“I’m hoping to do some good in the world!” Ron laughed.,7
"He had consented to the plan, given them his hair.",7
"Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.",7
He wondered who would do it.,7
"“Then ... I’m dead too?” “Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly.",7
House prices are skyrocketing around here!,7
“Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after.,7
He thought that there was so much they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined.,7
"Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was.",7
"“I ... regret your attitude,” he said, looking Harry full in the face once more.",7
"The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other.",7
"Harry had not expected Hermione’s anger to abate overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning.",7
"“How can he be sure what he saw?” “Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand.",7
"“But how — how do you — ?” “Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north.",7
"His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed.",7
"An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!” “We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.",7
The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner.,7
Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood.,7
"He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached.",7
"Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so- called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force.",7
"“Good gracious, really?” “Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defensively.",7
“Put the Cloak on!” He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand.,7
He had never been inside it before.,7
"If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind  Snape it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban — and that’s if they’re lucky.",7
"He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.” Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose.",7
The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.,7
"“How did it offend you?” “It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said Hermione coolly.",7
“There can’t be anything there.,7
"“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.” “Oh, all right,” said Harry, lowering his wand, “but I had to check, didn’t I?” “Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check.",7
"It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you wouldn’t say he was free.”  Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands.",7
"“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in Bellatrix’s commanding, arrogant voice.",7
He felt he had stepped back in time.,7
Ron looked down at his hands.,7
At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall.,7
"“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past.",7
They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle.,7
"“Are you a wizard, or what?” “Oh — right — yeah — ” Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said, “Wingardium Leviosal” The twig flew up from the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow’s ominously swaying branches.",7
"“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron.",7
"Thanks, Neville.” But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on.",7
“What did you do that for?,7
"Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, “Relashiol” The cuffs broke open with loud bangs.",7
"In the split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter.",7
"Hermione’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s, but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay still!” He felt the elf freeze and released him.",7
“The other teachers won’t stand for this.,7
"Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces.",7
... Snape had seen to that.,7
"Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely breathe or see for dust.",7
Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them.,7
"A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling.",7
"...  And he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and stared over it.",7
"Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash.",7
"“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said Harry.",7
"“A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!”  “I only meant — do you know where it is?",7
"My father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a well-known broomstick designer, look  him up, I tell you — get your hands off me, get your hands off—” “This is your final warning,” said Umbridge’s soft voice, magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate screams.",7
"Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle.",7
"“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him.",7
"Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit- pupiled.",7
"“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we?",7
"“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room.",7
“You didn’t break into Gringotts?” “They did!” said Neville.,7
"Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again.",7
"Anyway,” Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and Gran’s on the run.",7
"“You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name, Weasley?” growled Greyback.",7
"He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his  theory was right.",7
I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors?,7
"Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey.",7
"Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness.",7
"He walked  back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.",7
None of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it.,7
"The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys.",7
"Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s  computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content.",7
"“Fleur’s looking after her.” Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it.",7
"“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again.",7
"They’re rare, them.” “Hagrid, thanks!”  “ ’S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid- sized hand.",7
"“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there.” “What d’you — ?” “As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then — well, I think he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!” “But then, where’s he?",7
He did not want to be tempted to fight.,7
"Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were  covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue.",7
"“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe: His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before.",7
Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame.,7
"“Stun him and hell crush half the castle — ”  “HAGGER?” Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant.",7
"It was, many years ago, stolen from me!”  “Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch.",7
"He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next.",7
"He wondered whether she could make him out at all;  even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.",7
"“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge.",7
We wondered what it meant.” Xenophilius raised his eyebrows.,7
"Well, we can’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means — I don’t even know whether Grindelwald’s still alive — but we can ask Mr. Lovegood.",7
"“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.” “That’s brilliant, congrat — ” “All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later!” roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen.",7
"“But I haven’t got a problem calling him V — ” “NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them.",7
And Master Regulus said ... he said ...” The old elf rocked faster than ever.,7
"Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron.",7
"Cruciol” Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into the air;  the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.",7
I hope we meet again.,7
He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall.,7
and the diadem?” “It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me.,7
“You dug the grave.” “So?” Griphook did not answer.,7
"If so, he had been wrong.",7
"“What?” “Look at this!” The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the name.",7
"“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville.",7
"Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge’s office, and closed the door behind him.",7
"“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.",7
"Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them.",7
"Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear — He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.",7
He pushed the door: It was locked.,7
"the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?” “Exactly.” Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, “Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance.",7
"“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase.",7
"“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them.",7
"I’ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,” she shouted at Harry.",7
"Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.",7
... I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise.,7
"The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.",7
"While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon.",7
"Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy.",7
"You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do.",7
"“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley.",7
"We talked ourselves into going there, and — ” “But it keeps appearing, Harry!",7
"Albus Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute  of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles.",7
"His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies.",7
"There’s no Vernon Dudley on ’ere, Greyback.” “Interesting,” said Greyback.",7
"Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them?",7
"Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the dragon was still drinking.",7
“Give me back my wand!,7
"Due to the danger of using magic in your house — Harry being still underage, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you.",7
"“No,” snarled Greyback, “I haven’t got — they say he’s using the Malfoys’ place as a base.",7
Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts.,7
Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier.,7
“My Lord.” Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape.,7
"Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen.",7
Lupin fell over the threshold.,7
"“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.",7
“Now go and do something constructive!,7
"A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface.",7
It has not revealed the wonders it has promised.,7
"“Good-bye, good-bye — I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few days’ time — they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you — ” He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night.",7
"“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side.",7
"“And what about you, ginger?” “Stan Shunpike,” said Ron.",7
"I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.” “Information,” repeated Snape.",7
Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on.,7
"Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.",7
"The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry’s hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs.",7
The barman entered the room.,7
"“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.",7
“Her health was always too poor to permit her — ” “ — to permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel.,7
"“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly.",7
He opened his eyes and looked around.,7
"He therefore set off along the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment.",7
"“I sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother.",7
"“Sword,” grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher.",7
They were waiting: Everything was waiting.,7
"The door flew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined.",7
"The survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks.",7
"Mean anything to you?” “Doh.” “Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been Tabooed.",7
"Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition.",7
"But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited.",7
"“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” he replied.",7
"Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt.",7
"A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it.",7
Through the small space between their leering faces he saw Draco Malfoy.,7
"How did you escape?” Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks’s parents.",7
"I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse.",7
“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry.,7
"“There’s no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.” In the end they settled down for the night in a far- flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.",7
HERMIONE!” “How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream.,7
“Where Ve you put the Horcrux?” “In my bag.,7
"At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt.",7
"Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street.",7
"And Fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you — ” She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better.",7
"How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive.",7
“So you’re related to blood traitors even if you’re not a Mudblood.,7
A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor.,7
"“So what’s new with you?” As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.",7
"He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril — ” “I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall.",7
Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother.,7
"They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come.",7
He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest.,7
from that ... it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea.,7
"“Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag.",7
"His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard.",7
"“Harry.” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged.",7
‘Ron.’ And you said ... something about a wand.,7
It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and  gave it to his son.,7
"The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort’s when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry’s body, and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it.",7
"Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped.",7
But Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come.,7
"He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers.",7
He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up.,7
"As they had passed it, it had transformed.",7
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron, and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them.",7
"She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit.",7
"Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch.",7
"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.",7
Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden.,7
— would have expected you to attack back!,7
"As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him.",7
"Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see.",7
Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy.,7
"He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.",7
"“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,” said Harry.",7
"The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace.",7
"“Maybe once I’m there — no, listen, Tuney!",7
He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any more: He knew what it would say.,7
"Harry, still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind — — He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress — No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger — — looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower — He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices — — Time to fly ... “...to the Ministry?”  “To hell with the Ministry,” growled Greyback.",7
"We can just keep it in the tent.” “We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry stated firmly.",7
"Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak.",7
"“Well?” For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less.",7
“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?” They all shook their heads again.,7
"She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast.",7
I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand.,7
"I told you about it, remember, Harry?",7
“You cannot help.” He spun around.,7
"“Forgive me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.” He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off.",7
"The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants’ stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak  the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle.",7
“They will be here at any moment.,7
"Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.",7
It’s good you’re being separated from normal people.,7
"It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock.",7
"Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them.",7
"Look at this!” She thrust The Life and Lies ofAlbus Dumbledore under Harry’s unwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore ’s familiar thin, slanting handwriting.",7
"Personally, I find him an engaging child.” Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?” A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.",7
"“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, “ Kreacherl” There was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears.",7
"“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?” Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.",7
"“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron.",7
"“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry.",7
"As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them.",7
Neither can live while the other survives.,7
"“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention.",7
A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself.,7
"And I tried to Disarm him instead of — well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he?",7
“If you insist ...” The office dissolved but re-formed instantly.,7
"“All right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection.",7
I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time.,7
How could Voldemort have made such a mistake?,7
"He addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him.",7
"Perhaps I have changed my mind!” “You gave me your word, Severus.",7
"His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair.",7
“He was torturing me!” he gasped.,7
"Come on, let’s get going.” They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge.",7
"She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him enough.",7
“Is it?” He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks.,7
"When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then- traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers.",7
There were rumors about him.,7
"“He was a Death Eater,” said Harry, “Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed him.” “That fits!” gasped Hermione.",7
"“Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond.",7
"“Yeah, he might have done!",7
"I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy’s restraining arm.",7
"As he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head.",7
"“Well, there’s something we — Ron, Hermione, and I — need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.” Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore.",7
Nobody has seen it in living memory!,7
Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again.,7
"“Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered.",7
"But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done.",7
"“I’m doing it, I’m doing — !",7
"Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them.",7
“Lost an — ?” repeated Hermione in a high voice.,7
"“Do you trust me, Harry?” Harry nodded.",7
Harry lost track of time.,7
"Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.",7
WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster?,7
"“Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?”  Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, “ ’Er-my-nee, ’oo worry ’oo much.",7
"Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it.",7
Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley?,7
“Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were.,7
"He always knows.” The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole — And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch ’s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair.",7
"Thank God, thank God — ” Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory.",7
"You understand?” “I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused.",7
But it could have been so much worse.,7
Ron ceased his tapping at once.,7
"It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of road.",7
"No point locking the back door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking.",7
"Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.",7
"And you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark Lord’s name?” “Nod a laugh,” said Ron.",7
"It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace.",7
“BANE!” Hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes open.,7
He could not tell her the truth.,7
"You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death.",7
"Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter.",7
"“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!” “And then there’s this.” Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in  his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see.",7
His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.,7
“What’s going on?” “Harry?” mimicked Crabbe.,7
"“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table.",7
"... Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to facedown in the snow.",7
"He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here.",7
"The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.",7
"“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.",7
"He was so devastated by her death — ” “Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?” squawked Muriel.",7
“Blimey ... You reckon it was this sign again?,7
"Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it.",7
She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to  hug him.,7
"Was there a way, after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed?",7
"“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said.",7
"How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.",7
"“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward.",7
But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed.,7
"Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore’s:  I open at the close.",7
"Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other.",7
...” He looked curiously at his cousin.,7
"“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone.",7
He dropped  a locket into the empty basin.,7
"“Why didn’t he say to him, Take care of yourself, here’s how to survive’?” “Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you’ve got to think about more than your own safety!",7
"And you, Peakes!” Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table.",7
"Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!” Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass.",7
"He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione.",7
"“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape ’s face.",7
"Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive.",7
"“He killed me with your wand.” “He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected Harry.",7
"You should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort’s nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?” “He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him — ” “Of course he told you that,” said Harry, “but he was Dumbledore’s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he’s been working against you ever since!",7
"“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole.",7
"I know I can — ” “I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience in his burning scar.",7
"“The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn’t it?”  “But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!” “You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron.",7
I’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves.,7
Anger was coming to his defense now.,7
"And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.” His temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and walked around, trying to work some of it off.",7
"The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape.",7
... Hermione ’s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip.,7
The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank.,7
“Didn’t 1 tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?” There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius.,7
“Er — what — ?” began Ron.,7
I heard you.” He was looking at Hermione.,7
Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto.,7
“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked.,7
"Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.",7
He looked around at the Sneakoscope.,7
"“Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.” They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot.",7
It was easier than you’d think; I don’t reckon he’s quite right at the moment.,7
"There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces.",7
"“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not.",7
"Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed.",7
“Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!” The elf nodded for a third time.,7
"The thing looked perfect, pristine.",7
"“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway.",7
Snape had an air of nervous excitement.,7
"While the knives sliced away behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened.",7
“And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill’s Auntie Muriel?,7
"“Harry, I’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.” “Well,” said Harry slowly, “I’m not.",7
"He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry.",7
"Dobby’s enormous, tennis-ball-shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears.",7
"He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to- back to the four other prisoners.",7
"“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring.",7
... Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts.,7
Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift.,7
"“After you have killed me, Severus — ” “You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!” snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now.",7
“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?” “I ...,7
"“Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood?",7
"“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad- tempered now.",7
"That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking a little anxious.",7
"“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make.",7
Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him.,7
"“You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?” “He can’t have,” said Ron.",7
"But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first.",7
"“It was stuck, stuck to your chest.",7
"“Draco, come here.” Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely: a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.",7
"“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,” said Hermione.",7
"“Excuse me, I must go and assist him.” With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps.",7
I have no secrets from you anymore.,7
"“I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league.",7
"“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione flattened themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall.",7
"“We can’t leave you here,” said Dean.",7
"And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.” “Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron.",7
“Why?” “Because you got the sword out of the pool.,7
"“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my presence is not welcome ...” Harry recognized his voice now; Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.",7
...” He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down.,7
"Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply.",7
"“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.",7
"“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily.",7
Its binding was stained and peeling in places.,7
"“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never been able to find it,” he said.",7
"“Shut up, Ron, we need to work out a way — ”  “HERMIONE!",7
"“Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here making vol-au- vents?” He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten.",7
"“Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.” “Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak.",7
Why even touch it?” Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore.,7
"You were the one saying it.” Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking.",7
"She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.",7
"I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that need.” I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card.",7
"Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.",7
Didn’t know what to make of it.,7
"“Don’t you realize, he’s right?",7
"It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack — ” “No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna serenely.",7
"He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer.",7
"“What did Regulus say when you told him what had happened?” “Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” croaked Kreacher.",7
"Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?”  He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt.",7
"“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness.",7
"Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them.",7
"The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them.",7
He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground.,7
"Tonks — Tonks has had the baby?” “Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin.",7
"As they had lost Perkins’s old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them another one.",7
"I thought she was ill?”  “Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect she had produced.",7
"Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!” “Neville, what’s happened to you?” “What?",7
"He probably doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!” “I don’t think so,” said Ron.",7
"Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they’re still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room.",7
"“Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time!",7
“Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency!,7
"You knew Dumbledore!” “I thought I did,” he muttered.",7
"The prospect of parting — probably forever — from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air.",7
"“C-Crabbe,” choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak.",7
"The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.",7
"“Look, when we three don’t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone’s  going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right?",7
She turned back to Harry.,7
Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere.,7
"Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.",7
"You were at Ariana’s funeral, were you not?” “Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips.",7
She knew the Dumbledores for years.,7
"“Harry!” “Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend — ” “Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!”  Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint.",7
"“No — no — we mustn’t fight!” said Hermione, launching herself between them.",7
"Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter — ” “But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously.",7
Or is this about them goblets again?,7
"“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak.",7
“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over Harry’s head.,7
I assuaged my conscience with empty words.,7
"Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son.",7
"“Voldemort — ” “Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions.",7
"“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the Invisibility Cloak.",7
"Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question.",7
"The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared.",7
"“You didn’t disobey orders at all!” Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever.",7
"How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping?",7
“We had to keep her safe and quiet.,7
"All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores — goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!” “Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge.",7
“Legends about a wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to hand by murder.”  Ollivander turned pale.,7
Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying.,7
He could not draw breath.,7
And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage?,7
"Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the  oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family.",7
"“What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked.",7
“I’ve got a job — ” “Give it to someone else!” “I can’t.,7
"“I resented it, Harry.” Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly.",7
They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart.,7
"It all makes sense!” He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two.",7
"With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.",7
"“Where’s Hermione?” “They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder.",7
"As he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall.",7
"He burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.",7
“But what about Tonks?” she asked.,7
"“ Your mother confessed,” sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, “that she would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange ...” “Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met.",7
"“We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron.",7
"“Okay,” he called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them looked alert, excited.",7
"“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him.",7
"“Mad-Eye.”  “Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank.",7
"“Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember?",7
"“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.” They stepped out of the alleyway together.",7
"Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.",7
"“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill, don’t look at me — I’m ’ideous.” “Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa.",7
"“Easy, Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the others.",7
"Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.",7
"“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s Hollow,” said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius.",7
"I know him not!” Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand.",7
"“We are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family’s Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the  moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the Dursleys.",7
"“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground.",7
“You’re not going to go inside?,7
"“If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.” “Don’t you dare speak to Draco like — ” said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed,  “Be quiet!",7
He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.,7
"“But that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday.",7
"...  On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar.",7
"Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page.",7
Harry dropped his eyes to the caption.,7
"Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door.",7
"“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall.",7
Her face was completely bloodless.,7
"“STOP OR SHE DIES!” Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa.",7
"Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her.",7
"He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him.",7
“Yet you have sustained heavy losses.,7
"“Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s been months — ” “I can’t, Harry, I’m serious — you do it — ” “But why?” “Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock.",7
The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.” Harry glanced at Hermione.,7
“Enough.” And the laughter died at once.,7
"Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes.",7
Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk.,7
"“Tonks’s changed, didn’t it?” “Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show himself?",7
Don’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find.,7
"“Because ...” In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts.",7
What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike?,7
He now proceeded a little more cautiously.,7
“Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through?,7
"“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux.",7
"His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword.",7
"Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners.",7
"It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.”  Harry’s heart was beating rather fast.",7
"As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room.",7
"“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?” “Maybe ... maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws.",7
"“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use.",7
"“I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand Galleons right there!",7
"“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry.",7
"“You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?” “Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” asked Harry.",7
"“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room.",7
"But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.",7
"“But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what’s thediff— ?” A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe ’s head.",7
“Tuney!” But Petunia was running away.,7
"“Hallows, not Horcruxes.” “Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes.",7
"He won’t be happy.” “Better go back,” said Yaxley.",7
"While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.",7
"“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently.",7
"“But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far too low cut.” Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again.",7
For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible.,7
"“That is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct.",7
"I don’t know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore Harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb.",7
“You want to give it a look.,7
He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one.,7
He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin.,7
“Don’t kill me!” “That was not my intention.”  Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches.,7
"Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light.",7
"“Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was.",7
“And then ... you know what happened.,7
"How do you know?” “I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s” — Harry remembered the killings — “he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe, the ring first.",7
"“If you want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than — wait!",7
"“What house?” “ This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to pulse.",7
Even You-Know-Who can’t split himself into seven.” Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once.,7
"At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the entrance hall.",7
"Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.",7
"Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked.",7
Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it.,7
Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.,7
"“Let’s move, NOW!” Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred’s body under the armpits.",7
“Here.” He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows.,7
"Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view of what was going on.",7
"Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “MudbloocL.” The scene changed.",7
"Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.",7
Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word.,7
"I’m sorry — ” He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him.",7
"“And if the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.” She suppressed a sob.",7
Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again.,7
"He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears.",7
"“Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!” Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark.",7
"“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall be harmed.",7
"I’ll do Potter!” said Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp.",7
"It was not, after all, so easy to die.",7
“Oh thank goodness!” “How is he?” Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George.,7
"Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention.",7
"Don’t try anything, or I’ll kill you!” They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar’s darkness.",7
"“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated.",7
"He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the  whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.” “What childish dream is this?” said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry’s.",7
"He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him.",7
"The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat.",7
"When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away.",7
"“Oh yes — an old family heirloom,” she said, patting the locket  lying on her large bosom.",7
I’m serious!” “Why not?” asked Harry.,7
"“They think I’m a waste of space, actually, but I’m used to — ” “I don’t think you’re a waste of space.” If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have believed it.",7
"...” “I do,” said Harry.",7
"“Protego\” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.",7
"To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact.",7
"“Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?” “No,” said Harry, his throat dry.",7
Neither of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either.,7
"... Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!” A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face — with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes.",7
"“Thank you very much, Master,” said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing.",7
There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside — ” “We know — ” “I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me.,7
"Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand.",7
"Why should I be any different?” He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole.",7
"Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent.",7
"An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck.",7
"“Harry, give me the locket!",7
"“I don’t get it, Harry — do you like having this special connection or relationship or what — whatever — ” She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.",7
"If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order’s help, his parents would accompany him: There could be no question of being separated from their Diddykins.",7
"“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard.",7
"Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.",7
"“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!” “Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,” said Auntie Muriel.",7
"He turned: There was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy’s last  escape.",7
"A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry.",7
"“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,” he said.",7
‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasureV ” He indicated the objects like ear trumpets.,7
Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold.,7
"“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer.",7
Harry had never entered his godfather’s bedroom before.,7
"Ron!” Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffeted by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know — And then Ron was there.",7
"“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, “right to my chest, and then — it just went straight through.",7
"Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve — “STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix.",7
"He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened.",7
It worked for Bletchley.” “Meteolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron.,7
"Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthen them — Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk venom!” “And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket — ” “ — and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he put it in his will — ” “ — so he made a copy — ” “ — and put a fake in the glass case — ” “ — and he left the real one — where?” They gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close.",7
"After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints!",7
"“Well, happy birthday anyway.” “Wow — that’s right, I forgot!",7
"“I don’t mind sharing with A1 — Teddy could have my room!”  “No,” said Harry firmly, “you and A1 will share a room only when I want the house demolished.” He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett’s.",7
Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her.,7
"“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to,” said Harry.",7
"Help me!” “Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.",7
"For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.",7
The two girls stood a little apart from their parents.,7
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.",7
"After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant.",7
"“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy.",7
He’s got a huge snake.,7
Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands.,7
"“I thought we’d settled this.” “It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, Hermione.” Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously.",7
"“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry’s face.",7
"With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet — Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand.",7
...”  He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expression.,7
"“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany’ — ” “Bag — right — ” Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it.",7
"That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.” The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence.",7
Ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse.,7
"He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.” Harry picked up Hermione ’s wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the entrance of the tent.",7
"All those closest to Albus — and I count myself one of that lucky number — agree that Ariana ’s death, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore.",7
"“I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry.",7
"“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in the book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed.",7
"“Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors.",7
"...” “How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering.",7
"It was never the same again, he had to get a new one.” Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead.",7
"“Chamber — what?” said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them.",7
“I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me.,7
"“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,” said Harry.",7
"Please.” “Harry, I don’t think, when it’s broken like this — ” “Please, Hermione, try!” “R-Reparo.” The dangling half of the wand resealed itself.",7
... She had no wand upon her either.,7
"“Release me, I say!” She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach her.",7
"“ ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’ ” Harry quoted calmly.",7
He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.,7
"“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding — that’s to say, keeping — it in here.",7
"The longer he looked, the more there was to see.",7
It didn’t look like anywhere in Britain.” “You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?” Ron sounded worried.,7
He thought he was the only one to find it.,7
"Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!” “Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry.",7
"I never returned ’er tiara.” “It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, “the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.” Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker.",7
He read the sign again.,7
I need to talk to them now.,7
"I thought we were both goners.” “Yeah, me too.",7
"Keen on his job, though, isn’t he?",7
"... “And he made you drink the potion?” said Harry, disgusted.",7
You don’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me!,7
"The plaque beneath it read: DOLORES UMBRIDGE SENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER Below that, a slightly shinier new plaque read: HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them.",7
"“I’ve got to go too,” said Harry.",7
All faces turned to him.,7
"“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly.",7
“But he’s acting like one.” “All the same ...” said Hermione.,7
"“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice.",7
"“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!” The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike’s engine: Next  moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view.",7
"“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead.",7
"Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.",7
He paused at the top of the stairs to read it.,7
"And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, “I knew you’d come!",7
"“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly.",7
"The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family.",7
"“How come you’re here?” Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all.",7
“What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken.,7
"“Harry — I’m sorry — I’ll explain another time — ” He seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight.",7
"The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.” “The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?” “Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily.",7
"Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you — ” “ — much less since his father has lost favor.",7
"“She must be alive, she must!” “Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron.",7
I’ve made excuses for you for years.,7
"It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me and they’d taken my wand.",7
“These are the Wrackspurt siphons — to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker’s immediate area.,7
Crashed in the garden!”  Harry’s head was swimming.,7
"“Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?” “I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said Harry.",7
"With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage.",7
“I stole the wand from its last master’s tomb!,7
"“ Potterwatch , didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called?",7
"I really want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in.",7
"So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother.",7
“They sneak out at night.,7
"Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.",7
"“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?”  “I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.",7
Sometimes you’ve got to think about the greater good!,7
"“ 7 welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values — ’ Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose!",7
Neither of you understands Potter as I do.,7
"The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone.",7
"In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot.",7
"“I let him kill me,” said Harry.",7
It is one of the most ancient chambers.,7
You have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked Bellatrix.,7
"With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air.",7
"It was nearly four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must.",7
Keep twiddling those dials: The next  password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith.,7
I could hardly believe what I was seeing.,7
"... “He read Gregorovitch ’s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight.",7
"This is war!” “You’re seventeen, boy!” “I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given up!” “Who says I’ve given up?” “ The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’ ” Harry repeated.",7
"“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly.",7
"Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher’s cupboard, and wrenched it open.",7
"The son of the Aurors, remember?” “Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man ’s- land between the survivors and the Death Eaters.",7
"He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.",7
"“How did you know — ?” “Oh, just your expression,” she said.",7
"“We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues — ” “The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up Ron.",7
"He’s not going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is he, now?” “Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry about yourself, breaking curfew!”  “And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub’s closed down?",7
"“The fire’s lit, but the cauldron’s empty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s slightly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel poo.” Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story.",7
"“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his companions told the barman.",7
"This is the wand that killed Sirius!” Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.",7
“My dad left my mum when I was a kid.,7
"Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing.",7
"“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George.",7
"“Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork?",7
"If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!” “But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!” Voldemort’s voice shook with malicious pleasure.",7
"The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.” And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment.",7
At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”  “We were hundreds of feet up!,7
Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him.,7
"“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,” Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat.",7
"The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow.",7
"“Oh, go on then, just one more,” he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again.",7
“These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news.,7
"“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand, “yes, very handsome.",7
We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!” But he was impervious to the veiled criticism.,7
"He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand.",7
"Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning.",7
"“Where are we?” “In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said Hermione.",7
"With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time.",7
"“ ’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you.",7
"“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.",7
"We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry.",7
"Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog.",7
"He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty.",7
"Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner.",7
"“The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide.",7
"Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so.",7
"“An’ you’re with me, Harry.",7
"“Ve-e-ry nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion.",7
"“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.",7
"“ ’M fine.” “Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin.",7
"“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed.",7
"“ To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.’ ” Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs.",7
"We’ve told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them not to get up to see us off.” They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the better.",7
"Where’s George?” “He lost an ear,” said Lupin.",7
The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius.,7
"“I saw it happen, I saw the body.",7
Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person.,7
"Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot.",7
"“The place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase.",7
"Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore ’s throat.",7
"The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag.",7
“Wouldn’t ... come.” Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed.,7
He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.,7
The scar on his forehead was still throbbing.,7
"“Here, Harry — couldn’ think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck.",7
“I wonder ... will we need to translate runes?,7
"“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated.",7
"Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as she could muster: “And what do you want?” Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.",7
"“Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.” Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, “What if purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born’s part of their family?",7
"“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives — !” “ — because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron.",7
"Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him.",7
"“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?” “With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort.",7
"Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep.",7
"“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.” “Another Weasley?",7
"He’s on the run now, just like us.” Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand.",7
"He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done.",7
"Thieves!” He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question.",7
"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?” “The — the what?” asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.",7
He left more than his body behind.,7
Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment: The Thief’s Downfall seemed to have lifted the Imperius Curse.,7
Ginny was over there somewhere.,7
"... Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George.",7
"Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.",7
ozzerwise you might find you ’ave a leetle less hair zan you would like.,7
"Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.",7
after all my mother’s care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.” Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest.,7
"Godric’s Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection?” “Oh yeah ...” Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hollow.",7
“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.,7
He thinks he’s identified most of the main elements now.,7
"You can see how good it would be for business: that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!” “Yes, I can see that,” said Harry.",7
"“You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore!",7
"The Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer.",7
"And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked.",7
"“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t they?” “You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.",7
"There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.",7
So close ...So close .,7
"If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself.",7
"There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent  attempt to break the tension, “So — ’ow eez leetle Teddy?” Lupin blinked at her, startled.",7
"“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced around her.",7
"“Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!” “You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other’s eyes, green into red.",7
“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces.,7
It was so dreadful for those two brothers.,7
"Branches caught at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter.",7
"“Kreacher, I’d, er, like you to have this,” he said, pressing the locket into the elf’s hand.",7
"And the week before” — another bang, another squeal — “when you thought we’d give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple” — bang — “Headed” — bang — “Snorkacks?” “No — no — I beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius.",7
What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-boms’ greatest champion!,7
"Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster’s office.",7
"Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.",7
The tomb split open from head to foot.,7
His voice might have been part of the spitting fire.,7
“Have we come to the right place?,7
"“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon Bogrod.",7
"We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence.",7
Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known.,7
"“I don’t want it,” said Harry.",7
"Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another’s wand.",7
Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?” “Because I know it wasn’t me!,7
"“So, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there.",7
"Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing.",7
Probably be blond by the time I get back.,7
"“We got away.” “Yes,” said Hermione.",7
"“Where — how — ?” “It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there.",7
"He thought the connection was dangerous — Voldemort can use it, Harry!",7
"And lastly, your pretty little friend ...” The relish in his voice made Harry’s flesh crawl.",7
"Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them.",7
"He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him.",7
"She said she thought we’d stolen it.” “Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,” said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair.",7
"“Griphook, I need to ask — ” “You also rescued a goblin.”  “What?” “You brought me here.",7
"“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor McGonagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it.",7
"He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape’s pale face.",7
"Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna.",7
"Could you give us a few minutes?” The goblin nodded, looking sour.",7
“Was it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin?,7
"There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione’s voice rang out.",7
"“ Freak).” she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood.",7
Now we know she’s safe too.” He looked around and saw Harry standing there.,7
He could think only of the Deathly Hallows.,7
"“Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,” croaked the elf.",7
He had known it all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there.,7
"It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib.",7
And then he thought of it!,7
"And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley’s mishap — ” Snape turned at the door.",7
"“Yes, I am.” She nodded slowly, solemnly.",7
"The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick.",7
"It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though.",7
"“If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but how am I going to get up there?” The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest.",7
Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead.,7
"Travers’s hood fell off when I cursed him, he’s supposed to be inside too.",7
"“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly.",7
She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window.,7
"Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything.",7
"It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him with something that was like courage.",7
"Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you!",7
"A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees.",7
"“I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore — we’ve got  to put the protection back around us — quickly — it’s how they find — ” But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why.",7
"“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron.",7
"Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.",7
"“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.",7
"Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends.",7
"“Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood.",7
He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose.,7
... master of Death ... Why didn’t Ron and Hermione understand?,7
"“Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed.",7
"“He thinks I’m going to go to him.” “But why?” “He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close beside him — obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing — ” “Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders.",7
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot?,7
"Slow torture for Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.” “In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,” said Dumbledore.",7
"I say we go — Harry, what’s that on your arm?” “What?",7
He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests: Slytherins.,7
"I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine.",7
"“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous.",7
"“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said.",7
"Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry.",7
“What’s the joke?” asked Dean.,7
"Voldemort would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes.",7
Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all.,7
“How can you tell?” asked Hermione.,7
"“Anyone still got a wand?” “No,” said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.",7
Fred looked at Percy with glee.,7
"He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment.",7
He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny.,7
"What did they take?” “A ... a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord ...” The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s: He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had ever known: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret?",7
“He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it!,7
"They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they’d come.”  “And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s whereabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.",7
"What did she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have taken?",7
"“Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running.",7
"They are the best — although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.” Harry did not answer.",7
"And that’s my wife you’re shouting at.” “Oh, I’m — I’m sorry.” As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder.",7
"It was nearly time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked down at Harry, and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother.",7
"Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort’s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could survive.",7
"...” And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: “You need to mean them, Potter!” “What do we do?” asked Ron.",7
"However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends.",7
“Slytherinl” cried the Sorting Hat.,7
"“Out of the way, can’t y — oh, sorry, Runcorn!”  Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away.",7
"The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur’s mother.",7
"Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.” “King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately.",7
From upstairs they heard Bellatrix’s voice.,7
"“ ‘I open at the close ...’ What’s that supposed to mean?” Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank.",7
“No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill.,7
"NB: Youngest son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed.",7
“Who is it?” Bill called.,7
"A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights  in the distant square.",7
"After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de- gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapes, however, Harry started to suspect her of a different motive.",7
"After a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow.",7
"“Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups.",7
"“The Thief’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back at the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water.",7
"“Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?” “No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so.",7
"Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.",7
"Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?",7
"He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed,  and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts — A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack?",7
"By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.",7
“That’s as much as I can do.,7
"I need to get under the Cloak!”  Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room.",7
"“Let it go, boy, before you follow him!",7
"They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day.",7
"“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall.",7
"“My Lord — let me go to the boy — ” “All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely  louder than a whisper, “wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner ... and I think I have the answer.” Snape did not speak.",7
“Can you forgive me for not trusting you?,7
"He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them.",7
Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument.,7
"“If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she said.",7
"Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys’.",7
“A special school for freaks.,7
“Are you — are you talking about your sister?” Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back.,7
"But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the castle — it’s me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a few more or less, not now — ” not now he knows I’m attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head.",7
"“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,” said Malfoy, his voice brittle.",7
Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark rite?,7
"“Harry ... Potter ...” And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.",7
Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on.,7
Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall.,7
"Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner.",7
"Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related.",7
"Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached.",7
"On the downside — ” “ — no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath.",7
"“Password?” “Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind.",7
"He was the only person there, except for —  He recoiled.",7
"“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus.",7
Harry squinted around through the darkness.,7
"Meanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think, what happened there, Harry?",7
"Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth.",7
This must just be his weird take on it.,7
"Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm.",7
"“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they’re tight.” “Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead.",7
"I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which  resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.” “Well, in that interview,” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.” “Don’t believe a word of it!” said Doge at once.",7
The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme.,7
Is this still something to do with wands?” Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting.,7
"“I’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,” he explained.",7
"“Is it — ?” “No, but look!” She pointed to the dark stone.",7
"More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet- black and forbidding; Voldemort’s thoughts had suddenly become razor-sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose.",7
"They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved.",7
"Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock.",7
"You still want me.” There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s departure seemed to rise like a wall between them.",7
Slowly the four tables emptied.,7
"The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power!",7
"“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.",7
"Dumbledore’s triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.",7
"“DONT!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised her wand.",7
"“They’re pleased!” “Yeah ... great ...” Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort’s mind.",7
"“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver.",7
"“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice.",7
"“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment.",7
"Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You shouldn’t have done that.”  As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio\” The Death Eater was lifted off his feet.",7
"She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket.",7
"“Best friends?”  “We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging round with!",7
A stillness had settled over the scene.,7
"How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead.",7
"“Didn’t I?” “You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding.",7
“There was a locket.” “What?” said Harry and Ron together.,7
"“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay.",7
It seemed a lifetime away.,7
"“All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered Hermione.",7
"Even if we’re not going back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it with — ”  “Listen!” said Harry again.",7
"Now,” he said, turning to Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?”  “We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start again.",7
"They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell.",7
"It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted.",7
"Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.",7
"“This belonged to Regulus and I’m sure he’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you — ” “Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground.",7
"“I’ll take first watch.”  And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance, bringing the action to a fierce full stop.",7
"Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age.",7
Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ grave.,7
"He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.” The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch.",7
"Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.",7
"Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand.",7
"“Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals.",7
"“Harry, do you want your toothbrush?",7
Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.,7
"“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice.",7
"Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.",7
"Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna ’ll be home!” They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchpole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning.",7
"“No, he’s still stuck in the bog,” said Ron.",7
At last they reached a door.,7
“You wouldn’t have stood it either.,7
"“I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.” “As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin.",7
"The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did.",7
"“Do you know them, then?” “Well, of course I do!” Harry looked up, diverted.",7
“Marvolo Gaunti You -Know- Who’s grandfather!,7
"Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside.",7
“We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks.,7
"“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf.",7
"He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn’t there.",7
"The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand.",7
"“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore.",7
"As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione.",7
His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders.,7
"Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.",7
Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands.,7
“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook.,7
I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me.,7
"“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them.",7
But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind.,7
"Please.” Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything.",7
"“As I’ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him.",7
When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside.,7
"Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction.",7
Ought he to know what it all meant?,7
"The Portkey ’s through here,” he added to  Harry.",7
"“As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along- Apparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their children.",7
"His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione’s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes.",7
"...” “What is this?” Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this.",7
"“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our family’s house.",7
"... No, surely, the rest were safe.",7
“No — NO!” The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.,7
"For him, the Elder Wand  has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you.",7
“Will George be okay?”  All Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question.,7
"“Don’t move!” He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open  and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house — ” Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below.",7
"“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron.",7
"He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock.",7
"I’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over  any Muggle dwellings in your street.",7
"10 KREACHER’S TALE Harry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor.",7
"“The Resurrection Stone,” he said, and he added a circle on top of the line.",7
"“What d’you mean, Death Eaters?",7
"They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied .",7
And you understood Wormtail too.,7
"Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room.",7
"Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry.” Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow.",7
He saw a few tiny movements from the pictures.,7
"“And what in the name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?” “I remembered this,” Hermione panted.",7
Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.,7
"Well ... I’ve got the book.” Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.",7
"Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work?",7
"I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer.",7
"“Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.” “This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour.",7
"The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister.",7
"“Isn’t it the same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?” “Well, that’s what I thought too!” “Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.” She stared at him, openmouthed.",7
"“I don’t get it,” said Dean.",7
He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry.,7
"“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid.",7
"I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts.",7
“They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they’re dangerous.,7
"Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water.",7
“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort’s high screams.,7
"However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald.",7
With a huge effort Harry forced himself on.,7
“I was safer at Hogwarts.,7
"I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.” And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like a death mask.",7
"He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, “Stupefyl” There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole’s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat vanished.",7
Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand.,7
Hestia Jones broke the silence.,7
"Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor.",7
"Thanks a lot.” Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville.",7
“They’ve killed plenty of us.,7
"The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.",7
"What happened to you, ugly?” Harry did not answer immediately.",7
"“Such a long, full life.",7
"“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself.",7
5 “Hagrid?” Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand.,7
“Mine still beat the borrowed wand.,7
"They’re all right — shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.” “The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?” Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden.",7
“But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux.,7
"“When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,” Harry began again, “you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard.",7
He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar.,7
"“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry.",7
"“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione.",7
"“Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius.",7
"Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet.",7
"He could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her long hair tickled his face.",7
"“ ‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight — ’ ” “Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen.",7
"Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once.",7
There’s someone here.” “What do you mean?,7
Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand.,7
"“But surely people realize what’s going on?” “The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin.",7
"Like Filch ’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name.",7
"“Thank you,” said the goblins together in English.",7
"“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.” He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase.",7
"“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?” *  He was lying facedown on the ground again.",7
"Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them?",7
Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door?,7
"“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?” “Yes,” said Harry.",7
“But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you!,7
"We’re the only ones who can end it!”  She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry.",7
"He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders.",7
"However, the truth seems altogether more shocking.",7
“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters.,7
"And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was.",7
"The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer’s day.",7
"It doesn’t matter to us, Al.",7
"“If you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods.",7
"“Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been in there, she was beside herself.",7
“Quite ill.” “How long ago did we leave?” “Hours ago.,7
“Why are you so obsessed with them anyway?,7
“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested halfheartedly.,7
"His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open.",7
"The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear.",7
"But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he?",7
"“I sought a third wand, Severus.",7
"He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens.",7
"He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole.",7
"“Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o’ that?",7
"He’s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don’t owe him anything.” “You don’t understand,” said Harry again.",7
"Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.",7
"“Harry, look at this.” He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter.",7
"...” “You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes.",7
"With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks.",7
“It came as an awful shock.,7
“Gone forever.” He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.,7
"Harry’s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met.",7
"“My dear boy ... what a surprise ... Minerva, do please explain.",7
"“What are you making him do?” “Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness.",7
"“Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay — ” But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth.",7
"Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.",7
"“That’s — that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse.",7
"Lily screamed: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears.",7
"They passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon’s fire kept their progress clear — And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway.",7
"Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.",7
"Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees — “No — HEDWIG!” The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again.",7
"He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together.",7
“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow.,7
"Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something.",7
"There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, “No!",7
He was quite sure that Ron’s support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.,7
"The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees.",7
"As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here.",7
...” Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy’s face.,7
"“There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!” “I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrimgeour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object.",7
"“If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s Kiss.” The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor.",7
I don’t think you should look around when he’s not here!” But Harry had already reached the next level.,7
"“Accio Cup\” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions.",7
"“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch.",7
"“Where would you say that we are?” Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known.",7
"Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear.",7
"The Deathly Hallows ... such rubbish ... although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t he?",7
"A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem.",7
"And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch ’s face was stricken with terror.",7
"“That’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a  glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t been lying!” “Why hide me, though?” asked Ron.",7
"Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry.",7
"At last he spluttered, “The Quibbler?",7
"The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour assured him, “but you must tell it clearly what you want .",7
"Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers — Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor — where they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells.",7
"That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.” “They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.",7
"“ Kill me, then, Voldemort, I welcome death!",7
Potter will come to me.,7
"Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.",7
"“You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape.",7
"Snape  looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him again.",7
He knew I was really sorry.,7
You’ve got to find out about them for yourself!,7
His hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip.,7
Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs.,7
"Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”  Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt.",7
"and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open.",7

Let’s just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth!,7
"Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night.",7
"It’s all right for you two, isn’t it, with your parents safely out of the way — ” “My parents are dead).” Harry bellowed.",7
"And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more.",7
"I’m telling you, if there was one place Vol — ” “Oi!” “YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past endurance.",7
"Some had merely signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had left messages.",7
"Hermione looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her.",7

“I’m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore’s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell — or perhaps a Dungbomb.,7
"This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend.",7
"However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.",7

"Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the  enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last.",7
"However, we have the means to control it.",7
“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry.,7
"“Reg, I don’t understand — ” “Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!”  There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had just appeared.",7
"He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his  hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s.",7
“I came running after you!,7
"Give it back to me\” “Hermione, will you please — ” “Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she screeched.",7
"All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats: At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax.",7
"The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance.",7
Tha’ one was my idea.” He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer.,7

"“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again.",7
"This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.” “What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers.",7
"“HAGRID!” He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder.",7
"“Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,” croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered.",7

"I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.” “But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?” “ ’Course,” said Neville.",7
"Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby.",7
"... As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place.",7
"Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?” “Accidents'.” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two.",7
"“You need to treat people like they’re scum!” “Okay, okay!” Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them.",7
None  of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.,7
"He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement.",7
... Relashiol” The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair.,7
"“I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.” “So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, “you think that exists too?” “Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophilius.",7
Known member of the Order of the Phoenix.,7
"“It’s not much, but I hope you like it.",7
“There’s something I need to do.,7
"Where does he keep going?” “He’s ill,” said Lily.",7
"“Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault.",7
"My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished.",7
Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room.,7
“You are Potter?” she whispered.,7
"“I thought of writing to you,” he whispered, “after Dumbledore ... the shock ... and for you, I am sure Doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears.",7
"“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said.",7
“Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the door.,7
"Barely breathing, he stared down at it.",7
But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem .,7
"The werewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort’s inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted this highest honor.",7
"Its power is mine!” “You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you?",7
"“That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge, she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.” “And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” Hermione asked.",7

"“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look.",7
"He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass.",7
"This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom.",7
“Look.” Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down gate.,7
"“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting.",7
"From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think.",7
"""... evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey.",7
