"Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” “How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.",1
Harry wasn’t sure he could explain.,1
"There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.",1
"Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.",1
"It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.",1
"Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.",1
"Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch.",1
"“ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant.",1
It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.,1
Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row!,1
“I liked him a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.,1
He had to start somewhere.,1
"He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow.",1
"He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.",1
"Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.",1
"All my family are dead — let me have another look — ” “You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” “You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s interesting about that?",1
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.,1
"“It’s for your own good, you know.” “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — this was a big mistake.",1
I suppose it’s here to break the fall.,1
"Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse.",1
Come on.” And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.,1
"Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” She said all this very fast.",1
It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”  Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them.,1
"At last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone.",1
There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.,1
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him.",1
Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.,1
He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door.,1
"“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others.",1
They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.,1
"As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror.",1
"“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all.",1
"The pain in his head lessened — he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes.",1
"When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.",1
They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.,1
Harry noticed him glance at the fire.,1
"“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.",1
Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.,1
"“It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that.",1
"“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?” “We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing — ” “Shut up!” Harry whispered.",1
"Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.",1
"“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered.",1
He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.,1
It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could.,1
He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself.,1
"“It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.",1
"After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.",1
Griphook!” Griphook was yet another goblin.,1
"He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.",1
"“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron.",1
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor.,1
"Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them.",1
The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.,1
"He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame.",1
“Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do.,1
"You never get anything new, either, with five  brothers.",1
"“That’s mine\” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.",1
"Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban.",1
"According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.",1
"“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps?",1
"That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.",1
"“We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have his key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.",1
"“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds.",1
"“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.",1
"“Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.",1
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.,1
"He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was going.",1
"“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn — that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone.",1
” Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang.,1
"“What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?” Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question.",1
"Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.",1
"KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry!",1
"The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling.",1
"I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.",1
"“Quick, tell me.” “Say ‘please.’ ” “Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” “Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.",1
It had grown three times in length in just a week.,1
How dare you tell such lies!,1
"“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses.",1
"“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped.",1
"Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.” “ You let the troll in?” “Certainly.",1
"Jc Jc Jc “Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.",1
"Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.",1
“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.,1
"“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.",1
"However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you 11 forgive me.",1
The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.,1
"Flattened in that last  match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.",1
"“We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant.",1
"Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.",1
"Snape, however, was not pleased.",1
"When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once.",1
"With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter.",1
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.,1
"Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t.",1
"“N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously.",1
"The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban.",1
"He’d done it, he’d shown Snape.",1
"Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,”  when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.",1
"The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.",1
"“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window.",1
Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.,1
"I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept buyin’ me drinks.",1
"The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.",1
"I’m waiting.”  “B-but I d-d-don’t — ” “Very well,” Snape cut in.",1
"At last, she clapped her hands.",1
"So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy.",1
"Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.",1
"“Can you see all your family standing around you?” “No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m Head Boy!” “What?”  “I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch captain, too!” Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.",1
"“Flamel’s just going to die?” “That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it?",1
"“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” Then she suddenly smiled.",1
"Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.",1
“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast.,1
"She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.",1
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.,1
You have been warned.” Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again.,1
"They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.",1
“All right — all right — ” he heard Quirrell sob.,1
"And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy.",1
"Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all.",1
Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.,1
"If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.",1
"Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground.",1
"Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to the moment they sat down in her first class.",1
"“He works at Hogwarts.” “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him.",1
"He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts  robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it.",1
"She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.",1
"“What do you reckon’s next?” “We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s ...” They had reached another door.",1
"And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.",1
"If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there.",1
It was stifling hot inside.,1
"Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.",1
"To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years.",1
"He had a deep, sorrowful voice.",1
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.,1
"Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.",1
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.,1
It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink.,1
"However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.",1
"But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.",1
"While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.",1
From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.,1
"Sir, quick — “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Dumbledore.",1
"She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.",1
"I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.” “You got there?",1
"“Some sort of test, I think.",1
"Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.",1
"“Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.",1
"“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, can’t.” Harry suddenly turned to Ron.",1
Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say please!,1
"I’m missing Agrippa.” “What?” “Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards.",1
"“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.” Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them.",1
Ron grunted in his sleep.,1
"He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.",1
They had practical exams as well.,1
Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.,1
The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.,1
"Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word ...” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.",1
Had that been what the thieves were looking for?,1
"Look down!” Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone.",1
"“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry.",1
"“Want to come upstairs and practice?” “No, thanks,” said Harry.",1
“Quirrell’s too scared to back us up.,1
"“He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.” “There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out.",1
All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.,1
We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” Hagrid dropped the teapot.,1
"“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry.",1
It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements.,1
"“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.",1
The neat fields had gone.,1
"“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.",1
It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for fear.,1
"“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.",1
"“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze.",1
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.,1
Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.,1
"He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word.",1
"Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.",1
“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?” Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.,1
"Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then.",1
"Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.",1
Wood was working the team harder than ever.,1
"“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.",1
"Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.",1
"Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much.",1
"His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it?",1
“Just what I always wanted.,1
"“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?” The hall looked spectacular.",1
"Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.",1
"Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.",1
"“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off.",1
Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.” Hermione left.,1
"“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly.",1
"The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.",1
Professor M. McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost.,1
I know ...” he said heavily.,1
He pulled out the  cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.,1
"I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit.",1
"“We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.” Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.",1
"“We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just  give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.” “I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly.",1
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in amazement.,1
It was a pair of glasses.,1
"“Well, there you are, boy.",1
"“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own — ” “What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room.",1
"“And you have another visitor.” “Oh, good,” said Harry.",1
Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight.,1
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening.,1
"This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.",1
"How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse.",1
They went off to lunch.,1
"“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered.",1
"Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.",1
He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.,1
"Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- 0, rice pudding ... As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.",1
"“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father.",1
"“An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope.",1
"Ear wax!” Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.",1
“The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone!,1
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.,1
"Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.",1
"Let’s try you out with a few of these.” He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.",1
Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.,1
"He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination.",1
What on earth was he going to do?,1
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron.,1
"Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.",1
"“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” He grinned at Harry’s amazement.",1
But the night’s surprises weren’t over.,1
Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.,1
"Got time fer a drink?” “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.",1
"All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.",1
"Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle.",1
"The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him “the Seeker.” Hermione and Neville were suffering, too.",1
"“How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — “POTTER!” Snape ’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg.",1
"“Do something,” he said desperately.",1
"Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).",1
But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his  cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.,1
"“And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” “I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.",1
"“He really knows me now, watch.",1
"Shame about not finding Flamel, though.",1
"“I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.” His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted.",1
Seven years there and he won’t know himself.,1
Harry looked in the bowl again.,1
"""... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus ...” “Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice icy.",1
“Are you all right?” said Ron.,1
"“I think Mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.” “So you must know loads of magic already.” The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.",1
He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.,1
"“Come on, I can’t breathe.” He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.",1
"His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.",1
"They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since.",1
"“Unusually bright.” “Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,” said Hagrid.",1
"“There’s an owl — ” “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.",1
He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers.,1
"“Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it was nothing, dear.” “Ready, are you?” It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people.",1
"“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said.",1
It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.,1
"He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.",1
"His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.",1
"“Bad news, Vernon,” she said.",1
"Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors!",1
Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks?,1
"Hermione, you’d better do that.” “Why me?” “It’s obvious,” said Ron.",1
It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.,1
"“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.",1
Harry peered out of the window.,1
"His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.",1
"A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last  place you would expect astonishing things to happen.",1
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.,1
"He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you  know?",1
“Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it.,1
"“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” “ Georg e\” “Only joking, Mom.” The train began to move.",1
Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.,1
"“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter ... what an honor.” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.",1
"The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.",1
You may go.” They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.,1
"“Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.",1
“I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name.,1
"“We must be miles under the school,” she said.",1
Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.,1
"“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered.",1
"“ — packed with Muggles, of course — ” Harry swung round.",1
“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers.,1
"Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.",1
"Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.",1
This wasn’t what you’d call comforting.,1
It was standing on a trapdoor.,1
"“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.",1
"“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.",1
"“Mom and Dad were in it, too.",1
"Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.",1
"Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor.",1
This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t tried.,1
"“We could lock it in.” “Good idea,” said Ron nervously.",1
"It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a  smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.",1
"“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall.",1
"“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again.",1
“Excuse me.” They both looked up.,1
"Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh ...” His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “... you’ve forgotten something ...” Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.",1
"Stay close behind me, now.",1
"“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” “UP!” everyone shouted.",1
“How do you know — ?” she spluttered.,1
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.,1
"“Come on, run, run\” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.",1
"The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there  was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.",1
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground.,1
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — “AAAAARRRGH !,1
Same night he tried ter kill you.,1
"He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.",1
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.,1
“HARRY POTTER!” His heart sank faster than he’d just dived.,1
"Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.",1
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.,1
Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2.,1
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.,1
"I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” He opened the crate.",1
"“You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” “Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.",1
"Go on, go on, try it out.” Harry tried.",1
“It was only a dream.” But he wished he hadn’t said anything.,1
"They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.",1
“No wonder Snape’s after it!,1
"The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book.",1
He’d never been inside the stadium before.,1
"Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t he?",1
"“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.",1
"“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years.",1
His aunt and uncle stared.,1
"Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.",1
What good’s that ter anyone?,1
"It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.",1
“I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces.,1
"“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last.",1
"He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins.",1
"As they entered November, the weather turned very cold.",1
"“Back, Fang.” He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.",1
A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.,1
“That’s hardly one swallow.” They looked at each other.,1
"George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.",1
"He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something.",1
It looked like an unused classroom.,1
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window.",1
"We may as well go and join the celebrations.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this bike away.",1
"“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet.",1
"“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” "" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again.",1
"“Play Quidditch at all?”  “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.",1
"“The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to — ” “How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.",1
Shooting stars all over Britain?,1
Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him?,1
"Blimey, Harry, everyone ’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems.",1
"A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.",1
"Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut.",1
"Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important.",1
He was shaking and out of breath.,1
Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.,1
“Go on.” Harry pushed it open.,1
"“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.",1
"These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.",1
"“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George.",1
There was a very embarrassed pause.,1
"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning.",1
"Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke.",1
And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail.,1
"“We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably.",1
"This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from.",1
"...” “I can only see you.” “Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.",1
They stepped through the archway.,1
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.,1
"“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit.",1
He was pale and his eyes were glittering.,1
She had started drawing up study schedules and color-coding all her notes.,1
Mr. Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower.,1
"“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.",1
He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours.,1
"“Harryl” Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.",1
"You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.” “Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week.",1
"He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?",1
Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight.,1
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.,1
"Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM!",1
"He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on.",1
He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there.,1
"“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably.",1
"Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.",1
"He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.",1
"Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.",1
"As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.",1
He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.,1
"“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy.",1
They’re not throwing me out after that.” After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.,1
Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me.,1
It was now sitting on his garden wall.,1
"It stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did.",1
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.,1
"... See yeh soon, Harry.” The train pulled out of the station.",1
but your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to protect you.,1
"Now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” Harry stood up.",1
Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!” “But why?,1
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.,1
"Yes, boy, your parents were brave.",1
“Everything we need is here on this paper.,1
“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.,1
"He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.",1
"“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.",1
"It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore ’ll think we made it up to get him sacked.",1
“Let me think — let me think ...” The white queen turned her blank face toward him.,1
"“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be — ?” The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.",1
"“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione.",1
"Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.",1
"He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full.",1
"Plenty of courage, I see.",1
Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy.,1
"“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid.",1
but — Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.,1
"“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.”  “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry.",1
"“Stay on the path, I’ll come back for yeh!” They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.",1
"Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.",1
“I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards.,1
"“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid.",1
“ They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home.,1
"Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.",1
"The ghosts didn’t help, either.",1
He eyed them angrily as he passed.,1
"Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.",1
"“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall.",1
Your aunt and I have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit big for it .,1
“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.,1
hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me.,1
“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.,1
"Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap.",1
"“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly.",1
"“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff,  So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we’ve forgot, Just do your best, we’ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.” Everybody finished the song at different times.",1
"“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood had said.",1
"When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.",1
Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.,1
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice.,1
"“Platform what?” “Nine and three-quarters.” “Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon.",1
"Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.",1
"They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.",1
"Good luck, all of you.” Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.",1
"Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more  stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.",1
"“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant.",1
"Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh.",1
Harry and Ron didn’t talk much.,1
"Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.",1
The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.,1
"“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, / don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so — ” But what they were, they didn’t find out.",1
"With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.",1
"They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren’t allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors.",2
"The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...” Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before.",2
“Dumbledore ’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!” he hissed.,2
The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday.,2
Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her.,2
"“And so you met Tom Riddle,” said Dumbledore thoughtfully.",2
"I’d have died of fear if I’d been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and — zap — just fantastic.",2
"“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake.",2
"“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,” said Malfoy slowly.",2
"“This means,” said Harry, “I can’t be the only Parselmouth in the school.",2
She’s been dying to hear ...” Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.,2
"The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.",2
"“Bet it tastes disgusting.” “Add yours, then,” said Hermione.",2
Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop.,2
"“Well, that’s an interesting question,” said Riddle pleasantly.",2
“I’ve had loads of practice with the Dursleys.,2
Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey.,2
"In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again — ” “Haven’t I already told you,” said Riddle quietly, “that killing Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore?",2
"...” “You be careful, Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door.",2
Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron’s head.,2
"He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.",2
"The four long House tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray).",2
"“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said, and Harry’s heart lightened considerably.",2
"“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said slowly.",2
“We think we know where it is.,2
"The longer you talk,” he added softly, “the longer you stay alive.” Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances.",2
"What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.",2
Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.,2
"His diary would probably tell us everything — where the Chamber is,  and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it — the person who’s behind the attacks this time wouldn’t want that lying around, would they?” “That’s a brilliant theory, Hermione,” said Ron, “with just one tiny little flaw.",2
"“Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one’ll ever know.",2
"“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket,  “that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?” “Oh — yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.",2
"“You heard him — ‘You’ll be next, MudbloodsV — come on, you’ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know it’s him — ” “Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?” said Hermione skeptically.",2
"Next thing we know, Filch ’s cat’s attacked.",2
He was looking pale and stunned.,2
Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.,2
In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart.,2
Harry didn’t feel hungry anymore.,2
"Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, Draco.” Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, “I thought you were going to buy me a present.”  “I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.",2
"“He hates me.” “Draco Malfoy?” said George, turning around.",2
Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart’s office.,2
"Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.",2
"Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they’d locked Crabbe and Goyle.",2
"Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir.",2
“You don’t have to take my word for it.,2
"“You’ve read his books — look at all those amazing things he’s done — ” “He says he’s done,” Ron muttered.",2
"Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid’s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile.",2
"By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high.",2
"Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.",2
"“What the — ?” Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry.",2
"The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead.",2
“We should all be in position at eight o’clock.,2
They were moving into the very heart of the forest.,2
Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.,2
"Mr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze.",2
Justin ... Justin must’ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick!,2
"He couldn’t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive.",2
“They’d have to be really thick.,2
"Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.",2
"“You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?” said Riddle.",2
She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively.,2
Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons.,2
"— and Madam Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a bit.” As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided.",2
"“Well, dear, I think you’ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if — er — he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth.",2
What was that writing on the wall about?,2
"“Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle.",2
"I’ll — ” “Argus'.” Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers.",2
"“Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore.",2
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart.",2
"Ron, however, was looking happier than he’d looked in days.",2
"They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.",2
“What do you want with him?” said Ernie in a quavering voice.,2
"He threw it into the basin and continued, “I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t make any difference at all.",2
"“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them.",2
“What if it’s a bathroom?,2
"“You won’t be needing it,” he said.",2
"“Er, no,” said Ron, “he had to work tonight.",2
"“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said.",2
"SNIFF — SMELL HIM!” Harry was on his feet, ready.",2
"You could have been saying anything — no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something — it was creepy, you know — ” Harry gaped at him.",2
Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.,2
He guards the goal posts.,2
"If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later.",2
"“I’d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that — to that — ” “You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?” said Dippet curiously.",2
"In fact, I prefer it this way.",2
"“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering.",2
"Petunia, you will be — ?” “In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.” “Good, good.",2
"“Yes, nice, isn’t it?” he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron’s face.",2
"Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, “Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle.",2
Did it work?” Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom.,2
Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died.,2
"He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.",2
“You’ll have to stay the night.,2
Over here!” Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts.,2
...” Harry’s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.,2
“Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I’m like him.,2
"...I SMELL BLOOD\” His stomach lurched —  “It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring Ron’s and Hermione’s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps — Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.",2
"“Harry — there’s something up there — ” said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry’s shoulder.",2
“She’ll be there in ten minutes.,2
"It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron’s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling.",2
Harry looked around the office.,2
"“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window.",2
"Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark.",2
"...” “What, you reckon Slytherin’s monster can duel?” said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.",2
"Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy.",2
"A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling.",2
Harry had never been inside Filch’s office before; it was a place most students avoided.,2
"“Er — I don’t want to be rude or anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the living room.",2
"Filch kept it fresh in everyone’s minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back.",2
He raised the gnome above his head (“Gerroff me!”) and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso.,2
"...”  10 Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class.",2
"“Did you hear about Hermione?” “Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.",2
He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls.,2
“I’m just — ” “HARRY!,2
"“— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.”  A ringing silence fell.",2
"By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth.",2
"“What have you got to say about that, eh?”  “Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly.",2
"You know, just vanish and reappear at home!",2
"Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You-Know- Who’s inner circle.” Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy’s family before, and they didn’t surprise him at all.",2
This made Professor Sprout very happy.,2
"“Tomorrow’s the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe?",2
“Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid.,2
Something soft hit his face.,2
Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart’s eyes peering through it.,2
"The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor.",2
“What’re you doing in here?” Hagrid held up the limp rooster.,2
“He was innocent.”  Ron gave a loud snort.,2
Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.,2
"“Out of the way, Harry.” Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry’s room.",2
"“We’ll take separate stalls.” Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.",2
Another large pile lay on his desk.,2
"“I bet loads of people here can do it.” “Oh, no they can’t,” said Ron.",2
"“This is called a telephone number,” he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them.",2
"“There you are,” he said.",2
"... Don’t push, there ... mind the books, now.",2
"The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.",2
"Only came out last month,” said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own.",2
"Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.",2
"On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky.",2
What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there?” Harry’s heart leapt.,2
"Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his  glasses on straight and hoping against hope he’d be able to find a way out of here.",2
It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin’s heir.,2
"Professor Sprout’s arms were full of bandages, and  with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.",2
"Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf.",2
Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.,2
"... Ah well, guests first!",2
"“Urgh!” said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside.",2
"Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they’d be able to mend it up at the school, but he never even got started.",2
"Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.",2
"“So  long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir ...",2
"He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car.",2
"... Of course, it’s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking — they’ll insist they just keep losing it.",2
Then he lunged at Harry.,2
"“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,” he said.",2
"Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.",2
Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells?,2
"Mr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air.",2
"When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, “Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last.",2
"“Are you sure?” “Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron’s four- poster.",2
He couldn’t see whether Justin was among them.,2
Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the  ground.,2
“Preserved in a diary for fifty years.” He pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant toes.,2
You shall go now.” Lucius Malfoy had no choice.,2
"“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.",2
"They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw  the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak.",2
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty.,2
"“Delighted — and young Master Malfoy, too — charmed.",2
Then he rounded on Harry.,2
"Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.",2
"Fred, George, where  were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?” “We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,” said George angrily.",2
"“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,” he spat.",2
"Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked.",2
"“I — don’t — like — spiders,” said Ron tensely.",2
"“ — so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn’t get on the train.” “Why didn’t you send us a letter by owl?",2
"“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.",2
"“Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young — maybe it’ll be him.” “As long as it’s not — ” Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black.",2
"“Dobby has come to tell you, sir ... it is difficult, sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin.",2
"“He should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood, who couldn’t help grinning even though his Seeker was injured.",2
"Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an  unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting.",2
"But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in  the oven door later.",2
"From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, ""... tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason.",2
“This is our practice time!,2
It would explain a lot.,2
"“I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you’d like to tell me,” he said gently.",2
"“Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is free.”  Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf.",2
"“Not today, Mr. Weasley,” said Dumbledore.",2
“Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets?,2
"Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.",2
“Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year.,2
"We meet again, Harry!” Pinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.",2
Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.,2
"There wasn’t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel’s birthday, or dentist, half-past three.",2
"“He’s Dumbledore’s,” said Harry, squeezing through himself.",2
"The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.",2
It hasn’t gone for anyone else all game.,2
"“Said he needed him.” “Percy’s been acting very oddly this summer,” said George, frowning.",2
"“Harry,” said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head.",2
"“Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don’t worry about that — ” “Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley.",2
"Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor.",2
"“You’ll be teased something dreadful,” said Myrtle happily.",2
He’s been meeting her all over the school in secret.,2
“Professor Lockhart requested you particularly.,2
"For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle.",2
"“I mean, he’s written almost the whole booklist!” The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley’s age.",2
"London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.",2
"“You should have come straight to me!” she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm.",2
Surely it couldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again?,2
He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes.,2
"“Ninth in the league.”  Ron’s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle.",2
"“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at  Malfoy in hatred, he saw it — the Golden Snitch.",2
"“We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,” said Professor McGonagall.",2
"“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals.",2
"“Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?” “I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said Ernie swiftly.",2
"At eight-fifteen — ” “I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia.",2
"They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left.",2
Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him.,2
“Did it go all right?,2
"And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone.",2
"From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.",2
"“Prefect, Head Boy ... probably top of every class — ” “You say that like it’s a bad thing,” said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice.",2
"“This is what you have to do,” he said.",2
"“PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage.",2
Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls.,2
"They, however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all.",2
"But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn’t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.",2
"Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile.",2
"“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.",2
"But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I’m away.” The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.",2
"Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON DIED 3 1 ST OCTOBER, 1 492 Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.",2
"He raised the sword in both his hands — The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true — Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent’s mouth — But as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow.",2
“Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he sobbed.,2
"Harry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia.",2
“Was giving you a clue.,2
He had even signed a few of them.,2
Madam Pomfrey wasn’t at all pleased.,2
"His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.",2
"Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape.",2
“But I shudder to think ...,2
“Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter.,2
“You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.,2
“The flood from Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.,2
"“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,” she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron.",2
"“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.",2
Harry felt the fear drain out of him.,2
Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something.,2
"It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive.",2
"“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.",2
It was still putting up a terrific fight.,2
“It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!” Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid.,2
"More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.",2
"“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,” he said, not troubling to keep his voice down.",2
"“Because if  Harry here” — Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look — “and his friend Ron hadn’t discovered this book, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame.",2
"It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall.",2
"I — I mean,” he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley’s eyes, “that — that was very wrong, boys — very wrong indeed.",2
"I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened.",2
"“Can you imagine me taking exams with this?” he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.",2
Isn’t it obvious all this stuff’s coming from Slytherin?,2
...” He opened his eyes.,2
"When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles.",2
"The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat.",2
“See you next summer!” Harry yelled.,2
I will inform Professor Binns where you’ve gone.,2
“What’s the matter?” said Ron.,2
"“Percy’s in shock,” George told Harry quietly.",2
"“Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.",2
In the blink of an eye they were gone.,2
"“That looks more like Goyle,” said Ron.",2
It opened silently and they entered.,2
"Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t see him laughing.",2
“And there’s a two-week waiting list.,2
I’ve been hearing that voice inside the walls.,2
"“I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?” “Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!” Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase.",2
"From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery — particularly if one of your best friends was attacked.",2
"“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor Sprout.",2
"His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a  distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting.",2
"“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,” said the Weasley twins’ friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers.",2
The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced.,2
“Never ... never ever ...” Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.,2
He’ll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon.,2
They poked their heads around the corner.,2
"“Filch ’ll have me there all night,” said Ron heavily.",2
The pixies shot in every direction like rockets.,2
“How do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?” Dobby shuffled his feet.,2
"“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in your manor.",2
"“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson.",2
"Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’  vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knock- turn Alley, when it was opened.",2
"They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall.",2
"Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, “Enough demonstrating!",2
"He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup.",2
"She never shuts up normally — ” They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD’S ROOM.",2
Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn’t answer.,2
“I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time.,2
"“Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask — ” “You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,” said the hat smartly.",2
"Who was it last time?” “ I can show you, if you like,” came Riddle’s reply.",2
"“But you’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there — ” “Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He turned quickly to the others.",2
Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face  and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown.,2
"Dear Mr. Potter, We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.",2
It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty.,2
“I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.” Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes.,2
"“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully.",2
She seemed to be hiding  down her usual toilet.,2
"“Better out than in,” he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him.",2
"Of course, he’s got a lot on his plate at the moment.",2
There was a murmur of interest.,2
"“Dunno — ” Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes.",2
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious.",2
"“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as they scanned the recipe.",2
“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby.,2
"Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn’t be heard.",2
There will be no punishment.,2
"I know you’d never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said.",2
Then he started telling them everything.,2
Why didn’t Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train?” Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby’s sponge away.,2
"“Hey — Harry — come and look — it’s the Sorting!” Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall.",2
"He’d almost be  glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream.",2
"Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.",2
Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.,2
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene.,2
And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt.,2
"Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, ’tis too dangerous — ” “Who is it, Dobby?” Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby’s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again.",2
“It’s nice to see you out of the toilet.” Myrtle sniffed.,2
"That’s all I wanted to know.” Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand.",2
He had never felt so lonely.,2
"Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way — Voldemort was laughing — Harry tripped.",2
"I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced — ” “I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said Mr. Malfoy.",2
"Robes, jade- green, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other.",2
"I don’t know why you don’t chuck it, Harry.” “I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,” said Harry.",2
"Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don’t hesitate to ask.",2
"“You’re in for a rough night,” she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him.",2
She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.,2
"“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink.",2
Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary.,2
His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before.,2
"“However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale — ” But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns ’s every word.",2
Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.,2
"“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however — Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder.",2
“We’ve won.” And he fainted.,2
“We don’t want to be found here.” But it was too late.,2
And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.,2
"He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly.",2
“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said.,2
"“Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I’d say — ” Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue  Bludger into a box.",2
"Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear.",2
"...” “Perfect ... Dudley?” “How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’ ” This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry.",2
Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault.,2
"“It’s probably just tired,” said Ron.",2
"“It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.",2
"Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.” Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression.",2
"Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.",2
"“Depends where you want to go, Harry,” he said.",2
"I was sympathetic, I was kind.",2
"A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books.",2
Ron?” He looked over his shoulder.,2
But I know why you couldn’t kill me.,2
"“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a few things I forgot.” Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and  dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd.",2
"“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, “I think all this merits a good feast Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?”  “Right,” said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door.",2
"The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform.",2
"Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter.",2
"“Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said George.",2
“How about Malfoy and Potter?” said Snape with a twisted smile.,2
Is that your own broom?,2
"And people think he’s Slytherin’s heir!” Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him — but then — “I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly.",2
"“It’s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.” “You are,” Ron pointed out.",2
"“Oh, well ... I’d just been thinking ... if you had died, you’d have been welcome to share my toilet,” said Myrtle, blushing silver.",2
...” “How many monsters d’you think this place can hold?” Ron asked dully.,2
Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented.,2
There was a sudden hush.,2
They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening.,2
"He looked at Ron, who shook his head.",2
"Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.",2
"Very pleased to meet you, Ron’s told us so much about — ” “ Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last nighti” shouted Mrs. Weasley.",2
“ Name ... Harry Potter.,2
"Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then — He had gone.",2
"“Eat slugs, Malfoy,” said Ron angrily.",2
"I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it’s awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you — ” “Look, food!” said Ron.",2
"“Can’t be much further, can it?” croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink.",2
Why hadn’t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?,2
"Harry let Lockhart’s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or “Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.” The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him.",2
"He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.",2
"He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.",2
"Nothing to worry about — just to check how well you’ve read them, how much you’ve taken in — ” When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, “You have thirty minutes — start — now\” Harry looked down at his paper and read: 1.",2
“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.” He waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply.,2
"Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again.",2
He saw a glitter of teeth.,2
"He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much interested in anything else.",2
"Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points!” “You haven’t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?” said Harry.",2
"All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.",2
"And then he understood, too.",2
"He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.",2
"“I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady.",2
“They’re starting a Dueling Club!” said Seamus.,2
“That was the one I burped slugs all over.,2
It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place.,2
"It was all he had left, his only chance — he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk’s tail swung over him again.",2
"...” “Well, it’s not much use to you,” said Ron.",2
“Anything at all.” Harry didn’t know what to say.,2
"With any luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten.",2
"“I do not think that Harry attacked those people.” “Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side.",2
"You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.",2
"Except that the words weren’t what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin.",2
"All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.",2
"“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary.",2
"Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.",2
"sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable.",2
"“Because you gave it to her,” said Harry.",2
He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.,2
"Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished.",2
“But only just.”  Harry stared at him.,2
"It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises.",2
"The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter.",2
"“So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer — ” “Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,” said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill.",2
Gerroff me!” squealed the gnome.,2
What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s favorite color?,2
"Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts — It’s Magid And unless Harry’s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was “Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.” Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan.",2
Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise.,2
“Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes.,2
"As quickly as you can, please!” Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.",2
"“Help me, help me,” Harry muttered wildly, “someone — anyone — ” The snake’s tail whipped across the floor again.",2
“He was starting to grow on me.”  The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine.,2
The monster in the Chamber’s a basilisk — a giant serpent!,2
"“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Myrtle dramatically.",2
"...” Just then, the front door slammed.",2
"Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron’s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron’s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck.",2
"... “Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, “so you found out where the entrance was — breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add — but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?” So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes’s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword.",2
But monsters don’t make good pets.,2
"Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling.",2
"“But it doesn’t do anything else either.” As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.",2
"“Master has given a sock,” said the elf in wonderment.",2
"“Why?” “I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George.",2
“Urgent call — unavoidable — got to go — ” “What about my sister?” said Ron jerkily.,2
"“I’ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I’ll have to leave and — w-what’ll Mum and Dad say?” Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance.",2
He was none other than a fifty-year-younger Dumbledore.,2
“Now what’s up with her?” said Ron.,2
“One good push — ” Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.,2
I’ll let you have a copy of  my book.,2
"... As long as he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn’t — ” “Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!” shouted Mrs. Weasley.",2
...”  They went down the marble staircase.,2
"My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away.",2
Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.,2
"...” But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.",2
“He knows I’m a Squib!” he finished.,2
"“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions.",2
"Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.",2
It looked like an ordinary sink.,2
“I knew it wouldn’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school.,2
"He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous — It lunged blindly — Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall.",2
"“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.",2
"“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you’re — ” But Colin was so small he couldn’t fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, “See you, Harry!” and he was gone.",2
"“There you are,” he drawled, looking at them.",2
“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly.,2
"“As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,” Lockhart told the silent crowd.",2
"“A double portrait, can’t do better than that, and well both sign it for you.” Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.",2
"I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it — ” “Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,” Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice.",2
"“Get off!” he said loudly, and then, “Dobby\” The house-elf’s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness.",2
“That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris.,2
"People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw.",2
"“Awfully sorry, boys, but I’ll have to put a Memory Charm on you now.",2
There was nobody else to ask.,2
But his wand had gone.,2
"“Just a get well card,” said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her.",2
If I’m not back in an hour ...” There was a very pregnant pause.,2
Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears.,2
Even the pain was leaving him.,2
"Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths.",2
"“Well, it wasn’t a complete waste of time,” Ron panted, closing the bathroom door behind them.",2
...” He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.,2
"“There is no Chamber and no monster.” “But, sir,” said Seamus Finnigan, “if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin’s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?” “Nonsense, O’Flaherty,” said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone.",2
"“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement.",2
"They each  grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.",2
"“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” “They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.",2
It wouldn’t be the first time he’d collapsed on a delivery.,2
"Watch him ...” Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes.",2
Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork?,2
"Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls’ bathroom, the girls’ bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible.",2
"After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.",2
"Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar?",2
It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.,2
"I belong in your world — at Hogwarts.” “No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped.",2
"Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.",2
"“Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you.",2
"“ ’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy’s.",2
“Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.” “Did you see anyone near here that night?” said Harry.,2
Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight.,2
"We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir!",2
"Not since ...” He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off.",2
"They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to believe it.",2
"Harry hadn’t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late.",2
"He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking.",2
"If there’s one thing I  pride myself on, it’s my Memory Charms.",2
Malfoy’s face ... he looked ready to kill.,2
"Least yer not in trouble.” Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle toffee had cemented his jaws together.",2
"“I didn’t mean “WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?” “But I — ” “HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.",2
"“Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.” Something in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do believe me, don’t you?” “ ’Course I do,” said Ron quickly.",2
"The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame.",2
...” “What?” said Harry quickly.,3
He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing.,3
"“C’mon,” he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they disappeared.",3
"The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle, then — crack).",3
"“Five points from Gryffindor,” said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face.",3
“What did you go running to McGonagall for?” Hermione threw her book aside.,3
Price on request ... Harry didn’t like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost.,3
The only thing we know for sure is what Black’s after — ” “But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.” “We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe.,3
Snape’s thin mouth curled into a horrible smile.,3
And then — A cloud shifted.,3
"He had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up.",3
Madam Marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps.,3
“I called for time-out!” Wood roared at his team.,3
The door of the hospital wing burst open.,3
"Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too.",3
"“It came from over there!” said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of Harry.",3
Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces.,3
"There were only three other students, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year.",3
"“Remus!” Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing imploringly in front of him.",3
"The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays.",3
Will your aunt and uncle let you come?,3
“Well?” Professor Trelawney prompted delicately.,3
"A dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward Harry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak.",3
"“Aah,” said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down.",3
"“Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope.",3
They followed him to the door into his back garden.,3
The air was warm again.,3
"“We think he’s trying to drown himself.” Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair.",3
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me.,3
"As they reached the bottom of it, they heard voices.",3
"Harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies essay (“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) and at the rune translation Hermione was now poring over.",3
Harry couldn’t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat.,3
"“But I’m also — I don’t know if anyone ever told you — I’m your godfather.” “Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry.",3
"“Potter, you can skin Malfoy’s shrivelfig,” said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him.",3
"Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup.",3
"Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its originator.",3
“Are you sure?” Professor Trelawney urged him.,3
"“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads.",3
"If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues — ” Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone white.",3
"“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself ... There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest — ’ .",3
"“Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker.",3
"“You haven’t got a godfather!”  “Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly.",3
"I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and you’ve got Errol — ” “I haven’t,” said Ron.",3
"“You’re the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,” said Black.",3
Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.,3
"...” “I thought that was a bowler hat,” said Ron sheepishly.",3
“I’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.” Harry yawned.,3
"“But then ... ,” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind, ""... why hasn’t he shown himself before now?",3
"“Fellow seems quite unbalanced,” said Fudge, staring after him.",3
Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way into the station.,3
That dog on the cover of Death Omens in Flourish and Blotts — the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent .,3
"Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.",3
The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match.,3
"He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn’t pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead — he was nearly there.",3
"For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut.",3
It wasn’t a happy feeling ... it was an obsession .,3
Lupin is hardly overtaxing you — I would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows.,3
The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened.,3
"You behave yourself, got me?” “I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth.",3
"They could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside down.",3
Crabbe and Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly.,3
"Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs.",3
"...” When Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly.",3
“I must insist that you leave.,3
Crookshanks stood up on Black’s leg and made a soft hissing noise.,3
"“Er — I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.” Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several people.",3
"“The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.” Hermione snorted.",3
"“And ...” He hesitated, then held out the Marauder’s Map too.",3
"After me, please ... riddikulusV’ “ RiddikulusV’ said the class together.",3
"Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last year.",3
And then there were the dementors.,3
"Marge’s train gets in at ten.” Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.",3
"... Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed.",3
"Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and raised it over his head, ready to strike.",3
"But that wasn’t right, Harry thought suddenly.",3
I’ve just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson.” “A what?” said Harry.,3
There’s no point moving them all now.,3
"“Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t I?” said Hermione.",3
"“Go to bed, go on — ” “No, Vernon,” hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry’s.",3
"To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term.",3
"I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends — ” “But — ” “ Listen to me, Harry.",3
"Buckbeak, bored, was ferreting for worms again.",3
“Woss that on your ’ead?” said Stan abruptly.,3
"“How did you find out where he was?” Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others.",3
I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly don’t want Harry dead.,3
And out fell — a book.,3
“Look — He took Hermione’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it.,3
"Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle, trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows.",3
Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?”) so they set off for the Quidditch field together.,3
"“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with Crabbe and Goyle.",3
"Harry had never met a vampire, but he had seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.",3
"But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff ...” “It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way — ” Harry lay there, not saying a word.",3
"“Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy, eyes glittering maliciously.",3
“Are you all right?” said Lupin.,3
"“This is our driver, Ernie Prang.",3
"You can call us as witnesses — ” “I’m sure I’ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,” said Hermione thoughtfully, “where the hippogriff got off.",3
"“I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said Harry slowly.",3
"How could it be jinxed?”  “Sirius Black,” Harry said wearily.",3
"“Never quite in their league, talent-wise.",3
It had happened when  the car the two of them had been flying to Hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.,3
It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming back to him.,3
"Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor Snape.” Nearly everyone laughed.",3
"He was sure he knew what was coming — “There is something here!” Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses.",3
"“I don’t deny it,” he said very quietly.",3
"“Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles an’ Black took out ’is wand and ’e blasted ’alf the street apart, an’ a wizard got it, an’ so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way.",3
"“Expecto patrono — no, patronum — sorry — expecto patronum, expecto patronum — ”  Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a wisp of silvery gas.",3
"“He would have killed me, Sirius!” “THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!” roared Black.",3
"“Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically, dancing uncertainly on the spot, “please ...” Crookshanks darted forward.",3
If Filch really didn’t know ... he wouldn’t have to pass the dementors at all.,3
"“Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron.",3
It was going to get rid of him first.,3
I can’ afford to go ter pieces.,3
"“ — so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort — ” “ — and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like Pettigrew!",3
"“Is it true he’s mad, Minister?” “I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly.",3
"“Dunno ...” Harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread.",3
"“Who else would have assigned us a biting book?” Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.",3
"Feeling slightly more cheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.",3
The class all shook their heads.,3
"“You — ” Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn’t reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously.",3
"He could hear (though having no idea what Black’s voice might sound like) a low, excited mutter.",3
"“I assume that’s why you didn’t tell me, Sirius?” he said casually over Pettigrew’s head.",3
He does not yet know what will frighten the person on  the other side of the door.,3
"“Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens.",3
"“In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shack’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain — ” “ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,” said Ron, who was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying.",3
"The teachers have got to know!” “He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry quickly.",3
Malfoy was  still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment.,3
"Try and come to London, Ron PS.",3
He could feel its breath.,3
“You think you saw his ghost?” “I don’t know ... no ... he looked solid.,3
"“You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice?” said Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice.",3
"Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron’s large feet reappeared on the ladder.",3
"Harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast, backward.",3
"But it’ll have to wait until next term, I’m afraid.",3
"Harry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to Professor McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she who brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.",3
“I have never been much of a potion- brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He picked up the goblet and sniffed it.,3
“It has been a real pleasure teaching you.,3
His wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew’s chest.,3
"“They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked.",3
"Harry suspected that Ron had  warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts.",3
"“What didja call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly.",3
Harry looked up at the sky.,3
There had been a loud creak behind him.,3
"“It’s late, Molly, we’d better go up.",3
“We just heard ourselves leaving.,3
"She was right, she was right!” The whole class was gathered around Lavender now.",3
“You’ll have to tell me when you’ve found out.” “What d’you mean?” said Ron.,3
“I really want an owl.,3
"“Hermione, we’re going to save Buckbeak!” “But — how will that help Sirius?” “Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick’s office!",3
"“Don’t bring him in here!” said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.",3
"“Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go!",3
"“Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the season, remember?” The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch match, Malfoy had definitely come off worse.",3
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.,3
"“I’m working on it,” said Harry quickly.",3
"He had finally taken off his bandages, and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom.",3
"He patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though enjoying it.",3
“I want to ask you something.” Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.,3
"“How come Fred and George never gave it to me!” said Ron, outraged.",3
...” Harry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible.,3
“Why didn’t you let me fight it?” said Harry abruptly.,3
"Unless” — Lupin’s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, “ — unless he was the one ... unless you switched .",3
"“I’ll call about the World Cup!” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and Hedwig’s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.",3
"I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it  out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast.",3
His jaw had gone rigid with anger.,3
"“Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down — ” “Strip it down?” repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.",3
“We need to sneak over to Hagrid’s.,3
"“Harry, come here,” she said urgently.",3
Everyone drew back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.,3
“Are you okay?” Ron asked nervously.,3
Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut.,3
"You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night.",3
"“Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,” said Ron as they leaned on the fence, looking up at it.",3
"Harry could hardly believe that he’d left Privet Drive  only a few hours ago, that he wasn’t expelled, and that he was now facing three Dursley-free weeks.",3
"“Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.” Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione.",3
"“You didn’t pass out, though, did you?” said Harry in a low voice.",3
"Right in the middle of the picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.",3
"In fact, I think it’s best if you don’t ... yes ... well, I’ll be off.",3
"“The sooner we get on the train, the better,” he said.",3
"“Welcome!” said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard.",3
"— became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before — crack !",3
“Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth.,3
"Argh, no — Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field — WHAM!",3
“Get goin’.” But they didn’t move.,3
"“And?” he said, dreading the answer.",3
... It’s what I always wanted.,3
"“Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely.",3
"Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the room next door.",3
"“Like father, like son, Potter!",3
Look — they’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day.,3
"They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.",3
"“Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners.",3
"“I’m dying, look at me!",3
W — which lesson have we got now?,3
"“We’ve met,” he said shortly.",3
"“We must be nearly there,” said Ron, leaning forward to look past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window.",3
"Harry half wished that he hadn’t asked what was under a dementor’s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.",3
Professor Trelawney’s voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.,3
He wanted to do the seeing.,3
"“There are — certain defenses one can use,” said Lupin.",3
"He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.",3
"Ah, here he comes now!” If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor’s victory, it was this.",3
"Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle.",3
He was looking at Harry more seriously than ever before.,3
"Keeping an ear out for news, weren’t you, Peter?",3
"Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer.",3
"Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase.",3
"Harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon’s angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out.",3
"You’re trying to do too much.” “No, I’m not!” said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag.",3
He climbed over the paddock fence.,3
"“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt Marge growled.",3
“Where are you?” Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth.,3
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall.,3
"“Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout!",3
"He went to the Apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones.",3
"“We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be starting in five minutes.",3
Expecto — ” But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.,3
I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge.,3
"The third years emerged from Transfiguration at lunchtime on Monday, limp and ashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the difficulty of the tasks they had been set, which had included turning a teapot into a tortoise.",3
“Peter Pettigrew’s dead!” said Harry.,3
“What’re you on about?” “Down here — ” Harry looked quickly back out of the window.,3
"“Probably a stray,” said Hermione calmly.",3
"...” Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around.",3
"...” They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the Willow.",3
But it was visible only for a split second.,3
"“I wonder, dear,” she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank back in her chair, “if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?” Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.",3
Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to prevent this.,3
"Percy Weasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius’s escape.",3
"Hagrid “They can’t do this,” said Harry.",3
"The witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.",3
"Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of great energy.",3
"Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.",3
“If you need more.” “I should probably take some again tomorrow.,3
"Sit down, sit down!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.",3
"Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the Dark Arts.",3
I ’eard he thought ’e’d be second-in- command once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over.,3
"“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a quaking voice.",3
"“YOU CHEATING SCUM!” Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall’s reach.",3
Buckbeak seemed to know something was happening.,3
“Yeh can’ really remember who yeh are after a while.,3
An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law.,3
"Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.",3
“There’s Ron!” said Harry suddenly.,3
"Just then, they heard a burst of song.",3
"He explained what he’d seen; how, as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry’s, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.",3
Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away.,3
"“There’s enough filth on my robes without you touching them,” said Black.",3
So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow!,3
"“I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.” “Good day to you!” said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows.",3
"“I don’t know,” said Hermione slowly, “but it’s a bit odd, isn’t it?",3
"“Enough of this,” said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice Harry had never heard before.",3
“It’s always best to have company when you’re dealing with a boggart.,3
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry.,3
"“I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he said, sounding surprised.",3
... I’ll have to think carefully about how we’re going to do this.,3
"It’s normally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after.",3
"“Yeah, I like that stuff!” Lupin raised an eyebrow.",3
"GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!” Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put Gryffindor only fifty points  ahead — if Cho got the Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win.",3
"There was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London.",3
Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear.,3
"“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still injured,” said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously.",3
"Dad, come on — ”  But no one came.",3
He was alone ... completely alone.,3
"I’ve been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course.",3
"“Excellent, are we carrying on?” said Fred Weasley brightly.",3
"It was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle.",3
"At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms.",3
"“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put — ” Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to sink his teeth into Ron’s hand.",3
"Most of ’em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-’Oo gone, and they came quiet.",3
"“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.",3
“Yeah ...” Harry was looking out of the window.,3
THE DEMENTOR’S KISS Harry had never been part of a stranger group.,3
"Password?” “Scurvy cur,” said Ron.",3
Two whole months before he’d see it again.,3
"Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney’s tower room at lunchtimes, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though they knew things the others didn’t.",3
Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about.,3
"In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front door.",3
"“Some day Hermione’s having, eh?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.",3
"Next came Professor Snape, drifting creepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up by his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius.",3
"Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening.",3
"Harry was trying to count the windows flashing past — “Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.",3
Other parents weren’t likely to want their children exposed to me.,3
"Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing slowly larger.",3
"Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was very thin; her  large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl.",3
"“What’s that supposed to be?”  “This, Harry, is the secret of our success,” said George, patting the parchment fondly.",3
"An’ when reinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, ’e went wiv ’em quiet as anyfink, still laughing ’is ’ead off.",3
Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.,3
He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him ... about the screaming voice.,3
"“I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned, checking her watch again.",3
I suppose you’ve heard our exciting news?” She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy’s chest.,3
"“As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to use the House tables.",3
"Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.” It would have been very funny if the situation hadn’t been so serious.",3
"Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.",3
"“I’ve had an idea, Harry!",3
"Professor McGonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward the Gryffindor table.",3
"I can store him in my office when we’re not using him; there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.” “Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t apprehensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementor.",3
"Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain.",3
"By the feeble light of his formless Patronus, he saw a dementor halt, very close to him.",3
“Three ... two ... one ...” The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air.,3
"“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?” Hermione put up her hand.",3
"“I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and imagine how you might force it to look comical.",3
"“We didn’t — lose?” “Diggory got the Snitch,” said George.",3
"“This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his shoulder.",3
"“Okay — Scabbers, stay put — ” They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them.",3
"They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution.",3
"“Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange.” “Indeed?” said Dumbledore.",3
how long would it take him to find a teacher?,3
“Why did he run?”  Harry had been wondering the same thing.,3
“Pity ... pity ...” He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.,3
“It seems — almost impossible — that Black could have entered the school without inside help.,3
"Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team.",3
"I’ve seen yeh practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry hour o’ the day an’ night — but I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broomsticks or rats.",3
"Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment around on her table, looking for the book.",3
We laughed about them afterwards.,3
"“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still gripping the back of Harry’s robes with her left hand.",3
"This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin.",3
"“Just to make sure.” “I’ll do it,” said Lupin.",3
"“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s what.",3
"“The Ministry of Magic said I’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!” Unless Harry’s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking awkward.",3
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak.",3
Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius.,3
"The Dursleys had  completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.",3
"Well, here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all.",3
"A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.",3
"Terrible things, they are, and the effect they have on people who are already delicate — ” “I’m not delicate!” said Harry crossly.",3
"“But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.” On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, slipped the Marauder’s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast with everyone else.",3
"“Oh, how silly we’ve all been!” Malfoy sneered.",3
"...” Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly.",3
"Pull them out, Potter!” Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko’s tricks and the Marauder’s Map.",3
“And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron irritably.,3
"...” “Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,” said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully.",3
"Well, of course, Snape tried it — if he’d got as far as this house, he’d have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father, who’d heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life .",3
Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.,3
"Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he had once belonged to Ron’s brother Percy) and a bit battered.",3
"Them Azkaban guards give me the collywobbles.” Stan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window of the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever.",3
Bill’s taken us around all the tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them.,3
"Ron and  Hermione kept looking at him sideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.",3
She’s bin cornin’ down ter visit me a lot since Chris ’mas.,3
"“You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you.",3
"“RiddikulusV’ he shouted, and they had a split second’s view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville let out a great “Ha!” of laughter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone.",3
"“Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it?",3
"Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally, Harry.",3
Harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on Ron’s outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grass.,3
"Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House championship for the third year running.",3
"They were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence.",3
“He needs rest and relaxation!,3
"Then came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean Fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he could have had one of Fortescue ’s choco- nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom.",3
We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak.,3
"“Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred?",3
"“If you’d follow me.” Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom.",3
"I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead.",3
Go!” Harry urged his broom.,3
Are you all right?” Someone was slapping his face.,3
"A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be reported immediately.” “No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner.",3
“But we hope to catch Black long before that.,3
Ratty little thing it was.,3
And then he saw something to make his heart stand still.,3
...” She checked her watch.,3
"“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows.",3
"“Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,” said Professor McGonagall.",3
"but what is it?” Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his Firebolt, that it wasn’t good news, whatever it was.",3
It was one o’clock in the morning.,3
"For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall.",3
That was the biggest bit of him they could find.,3
"Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow eyes.",3
He stood up and pressed his ear against the door.,3
Let the  ordinary people worry about his safety!,3
"I didn’t expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would have been astounded if you had.” “It’s getting worse,” Harry muttered, biting off the Frog’s head.",3
"“Two of you.” He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.",3
He scowled at the dark ceiling.,3
"He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall.",3
I’m going to go and live with him.,3
He forced his face into a painful smile.,3
This helplessness was worse to watch than tears.,3
Hagrid wasn’t a fully qualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed.,3
"“You’re fighting a losing battle there, dear,” said his mirror in a wheezy voice.",3
"“There is not a shred of proof to support Black’s story, except your word — and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody.",3
"“Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dangerous Creatures,” said Hagrid.",3
"we can’t afford you to — well — ” Wood broke off, looking awkward.",3
"“Well,” said Lupin, frowning slightly, “I assumed that if the boggart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.” Harry stared.",3
"We heard him — ” “Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,” said Ron.",3
"He bit me!” “Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently.",3
"I — WANT — TO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!” Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.",3
Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron’s old wand had snapped.,3
"“Is he mad?” “Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin.",3
There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground.,3
"he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his arm ... they weren’t going to take him.",3
"And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.” Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.",3
The book was hiding in the dark space under his desk.,3
"“Professor R. J. Lupin,” whispered Hermione at once.",3
"He’s been in my family for ages, right — “Twelve years, in fact,” said Lupin.",3
Harry picked up the letter.,3
"“I can’t stand it, I can’t bear it.",3
"That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia.",3
Harry laughed as he put Hermione ’s letter aside and picked up her present.,3
"“Who’s that?” said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he spotted Lupin.",3
"It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot there.",3
"One of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month.",3
"“If I hadn’t been here to save your skin — ” “Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,” Harry said.",3
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the  doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees.,3
"Collect a teacup from the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it.",3
"...”  He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from ajar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.",3
What was going to happen to him?,3
"There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water.",3
"You can’t all have forgotten the password — excuse me, I’m Head Boy — ” And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor.",3
"If, as I don’t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.” The Gryffindors watched fearfully.",3
"“This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too, without turning a hair.",3
“Famous Harry Potter and all that.,3
"A giant spider, six feet tall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly.",3
"“What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.",3
No broomstick would have a chance.,3
But trust me ... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.” Harry couldn’t imagine when that would be.,3
"“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know.",3
"“Can I tempt you, Marge?” Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine.",3
Ron’s red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm.,3
“So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form.,3
"As the lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes.",3
"In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he was positively cute.",3
"The Dursleys didn’t sign my permission form, and Fudge wouldn’t either.”  Ron looked horrified.",3
"The most they could do, however, was to lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and  broomstick at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.",3
"I imagined that people would panic.” “I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly.",3
"You saw her leaving, didn’t you?",3
"Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and Fudge’s feet move toward the bar, pause, then turn and walk right toward him.",3
"“You had too much to eat, Ron — had a nightmare — ” “I’m telling you — ” “Now, really, enough’s enough!” Professor McGonagall was back.",3
"“He’s faking it!” “I know that, but we can’t prove it,” said Wood bitterly.",3
"Don’t think she was convinced, though.",3
It didn’t help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.,3
"“The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger.” “Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something!",3
“That was the scariest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.” Scariest .,3
"HARRY!” They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him.",3
"Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, and heard a woman’s voice.",3
"Forward!” Parvati walked forward, her face set.",3
I drifted off for a moment.,3
"Most of them go mad within weeks.”  “But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said slowly.",3
“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice.,3
Can I?” “I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!” said Hermione shrilly.,3
"“He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said.",3
"Am I just — ?” “It has nothing to do with weakness,” said Professor Lupin sharply, as though he had read Harry’s mind.",3
"Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid’s house, they heard a knock upon his door.",3
He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely.,3
"...” I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it’s my fault he no longer has a rat.",3
"If not, I’ll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September first!",3
They weren’t responsible for their actions.,3
"“He’s innocent ... expecto — expecto patronum — ” He could feel them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him.",3
"“I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” Dumbledore repeated.",3
"Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran  down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went.",3
"It’s not a punishment for him like it is for the others.” “So what are you saying?” said Ron, looking very tense.",3
Was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast?,3
"Completely out of control ... no, I’ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight.",3
"“You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching — ” “And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said Hermione, “and he said, ‘None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks.",3
And then the tree froze.,3
"But I was weak, very weak, and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand.",3
"“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face, “where they’ve got everything.",3
"Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.” The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph.",3
He had achieved what he’d wanted to do — the Snitch had disappeared again.,3
"A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room.",3
"“I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,” he said pleasantly.",3
“So it must’ve been really expensive.,3
"And have you ordered a new broom yet?” “No,” said Harry.",3
"According to Which Broomstick, the Firebolt’s going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year’s World Championship — ” “Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in the match?” interrupted Professor McGonagall’s voice.",3
"“They’ve — got — a — right — to — know — everything!” Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black.",3
"Harry started and looked around at Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.",3
"Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can’t see where it keeps its brain.",3
"They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other — Harry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to notice anything else.",3
"... You are all packed, aren’t you?” “Ron hasn’t put all his new things in his trunk yet,” said Percy, in a long-suffering voice.",3
"The Hogsmeade form wasn’t the only thing at stake — if he carried on like that, he’d be in trouble with the Ministry of Magic.",3
"It seemed that Fred and George had been right in thinking that they — and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione — were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it.",3
"I’m Moony — that was my friends’ nickname for me at school.” “You wrote — ?” “The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed.",3
"Bye — Ron  Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood quite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his clock.",3
“It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses.,3
"He had been riding one of the school brooms at team  practice, an ancient Shooting Star, which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his own.",3
Come clap this loon in irons.,3
"You’d have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way, or I will make you.",3
... She’s found some really good stuff fer me ... reckon he’ll stand a good chance now.,3
Daily Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black’s been sighted.” “Where?” said Harry and Ron quickly.,3
"Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin.",3
...” Neville was in total disgrace.,3
I was afraid you’d take it like this!,3
“I’ve already finished it!” They had a very enjoyable lesson.,3
"Even Harry, Ron, and Hermione had misgivings.",3
"“Oh, are we?” said George.",3
"“It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!” “Oh, what rubbish,” said Hermione impatiently.",3
"“Don’ listen properly, do they?",3
"I can see ’is scar!” “Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the Knight Bus picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now ...” Fudge increased the pressure on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry found himself being steered inside the pub.",3
Then Harry turned to Lupin.,3
"A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he climbed, watching his feet.",3
"“Ron, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.” He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg with his wand, and muttered, “Ferula.” Bandages spun up Ron’s leg, strapping it tightly to a splint.",3
"Came running into our compartment, didn’t he, Fred?” “Nearly wet himself,” said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.",3
"“So,” he said, straightening up again.",3
"“That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him — ” “Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated.",3
The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed.,3
...” There was a knock on Hagrid’s front door.,3
"Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge’s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.",3
"Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,” said Snape.",3
“Come on!” he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.,3
"“Send word with one of the ghosts.” Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, “Oh, yes, you’ll be needing ...” One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against  the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.",3
Says he can’t risk it happenin’ again.” Harry scrambled to his feet.,3
"Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.” Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry’s worries.",3
He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose.,3
Harry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time.,3
"I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and — ” “Hang on,” blurted Harry.",3
“Potty and the Weasel.” Crabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.,3
"“Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,” she said happily.",3
Harry poked the parcel nervously.,3
"“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid continued doggedly.",3
"“Well, honestly ... ‘the fates have informed her’ ... who sets the exam?",3
"“Look at him!” he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front of her.",3
"If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to power.",3
"He had completely forgotten that Buckbeak’s trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron’s face, he had too.",3
“What kept you?” Ron hissed.,3
"Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than he’d ever been in his life, but he could see.",3
The journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry’s trip on the Knight Bus.,3
Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points.,3
"“Don’t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole?” “Ask him!” said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir Cadogan’s picture.",3
"“Now what?” whispered Harry, looking around.",3
He pointed to the parchment he had been poring over.,3
A large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room.,3
"“What’s the matter with you, you stupid rat?",3
“Doing what?” “Getting to all her classes!” Ron said.,3
"“Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron irritably, turning back to his star chart.",3
"“Wh — what?” said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around.",3
"It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing.",3
For a few minutes the scene was deserted.,3
"Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were all looking thunderstruck.",3
"With a snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.",3
“Mount your brooms ... on my whistle .,3
"“You mean it?” “Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry.",3
"“I’ve not bin meself lately,” said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other.",3
"Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow.",3
"“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.",3
"“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said Angelina.",3
Lavender just got the news today — ” Lavender wailed loudly.,3
"“You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,” said Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive forearm.",3
Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up.,3
How could you?’ And then he went for his wand.,3
“Who sent it to you?” said Ron in a hushed voice.,3
... Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance.,3
Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead.,3
Tonight ... before midnight .,3
"“Professor,” Harry interrupted loudly, “what’s going on — ?” But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat.",3
"“Why — you didn’t know my dad, did you?” “I — I did, as a matter of fact,” said Lupin.",3
"Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione ’s boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.",3
“You’ve got to get out of here — the dementors are coming — Macnair’s gone to get them.” Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it.,3
"... With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch’s whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground.",3
"Pettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and turned his head slowly toward Harry.",3
“That’s my boy!” Wood kept yelling.,3
"“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, Vernon,” she said over lunch on the third day.",3
"“Now, I want you all to divide into pairs.",3
"But ... “Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do.",3
"As they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn’t carrying an owl.",3
I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.,3
"As quietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and down the stone steps.",3
Not a leaf twitched or shook.,3
"It’s not true, is it?” “I’m afraid it is,” said Lupin.",3
Professor!” said Madam Pomfrey angrily.,3
“Ron ... haven’t I been a good friend ... a good pet?,3
"Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head.",3
"“You haven’t been hiding from me for twelve years,” said Black.",3
“I DONT BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed.,3
"“Merry Christmas!” said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached the table.",3
"And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever.” A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor Trelawney seemed unaware of it.",3
"There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe.",3
"Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast together.” Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the hospital wing, muttering to herself.",3
"...” “Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked down the corridor, heading to dinner.",3
"Ron muttered, “Show-offs.” “Well, if you don’t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,” said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottle.",3
"... As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world’s best Patronus.",3
"Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.",3
"“Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast.",3
"There was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.",3
"“Yeh gotta go,” said Hagrid.",3
"“They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,” Dumbledore continued, “and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission.",3
"“I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secret- Keeper instead of me.",3
"Harry stood there, massaging the top of his head, listening.",3
"Crying something dreadful,” he said happily.",3
"“Hagrid’s just sent this.” Hagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible.",3
“How did you know about that?” Harry asked.,3
"“If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry.",3
“Who cares?” said Ron impatiently.,3
"As the end of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what had really happened, but none of them came close to the truth.",3
Then Harry’s thoughts wandered back to his mother and father.,3
He pulled Buckbeak’s rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.,3
"He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry’s opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.",3
“What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep the floor?” said Ron.,3
"Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn’t say anything.",3
"Harry gripped his flanks with his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.",3
“So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you capable of fighting the boggart?” said Lupin shrewdly.,3
"After the last match, you know.",3
Malfoy’s eyes were narrowed maliciously.,3
"“Let me see, let me see ... ,” he muttered, taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk.",3
"“That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily.",3
"“You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves — they’ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest!",3
"I shall keep you informed.” Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of the portrait hole, which closed behind her.",3
"“And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t remember anything she’d said.",3
"... “Hermione, think of something happy!” Harry yelled, raising his wand, blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it — I’m going to live with my godfather.",3
The entrance hall was deserted.,3
"Which?” “Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry.",3
"“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look.",3
"Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.",3
He took a deep breath as relief seeped through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged to the Grim.,3
"Under their influence, I became less dangerous.",3
"They hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his armor.",3
"After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.",3
"So, one night when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog.",3
"Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s package, ripped off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first ever birthday card.",3
She was a stern-looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles.,3
They could hear the werewolf howling behind them.,3
"That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!” “It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly.",3
"Quietly ... quietly ...” ""... as witnessed below.",3
"Hermione took one frightened look at the expression on Ron’s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the girls’ dormitories.",3
"“He doesn’t want me to join in.” There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn’t just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies.",3
"Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them.",3
Harry couldn’t help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too.,3
"Ron’s eyes were only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing, but he didn’t seem to recognize them.",3
"“Professor, I — ” “I don’t want to hear explanations,” said Lupin shortly.",3
His legs hit his trunk and he tripped.,3
"“Sh — she’s not coming here, is she?” Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s sister.",3
“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the hall.,3
"“Give me a reason,” he whispered.",3
The executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger.,3
Lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands.,3
"“LOOK!” he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.",3
"“I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but little Peter got the better of me ... not this time, though!” And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black’s weight fell on his broken leg.",3
"“He’s a complete lunatic,” said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy.",3
"By the way, my dear,” she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, “beware a red-haired man.” Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her, and edged her chair away from him.",3
"“But I wish I could have had a turn with the boggart — ” “What would it have been for you?” said Ron, sniggering.",3
"He had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.",3
"He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them.",3
"Harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room with him.",3
"Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright — Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in his ear.",3
... Jus’ thought it’d make a good firs’ lesson.,3
"“Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.” Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears.",3
"But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus’s bed, right at Ron’s chest.",3
“But ... well ... think about it.,3
"Nothing will have changed.” “Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely.",3
"Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood.",3
“You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them.,3
“A werewolf is only a danger to people.,3
"As long as he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night.",3
He therefore increased the number of team practices to five a week.,3
"“I must insist.”  Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward, slamming the door behind her.",3
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.,3
"I mean ...” He looked up at Harry and  Hermione for support, “Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he supposed to know which one he’s after if he was locked up in Azkaban?” “You know, Sirius, that’s a fair question,” said Lupin, turning to Black and frowning slightly.",3
"The first column read: Monday 9 o’clock, Arithmancy 9 o’clock, Transfiguration Lunch 1 o’clock, Charms 1 o’clock, Ancient Runes “Hermione?” Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days.",3
"“You haven’t forgotten that, Headmaster?",3
“But you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time.,3
“That means you’re going to have ‘trials and suffering’ — sorry about that — but there’s a thing that could be the sun ... hang on ... that means ‘great happiness’ ... so you’re going to suffer but be very happy.,3
“Excellent!” cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause.,3
"“I said I would inform them when our search was complete.” “Didn’t they want to help, sir?” said Percy.",3
"“Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry.",3
I’m jus’ gonna make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s time is the happiest he’s ever had.,3
"Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward, and  managed to flatten it.",3
"“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting before him.",4
Elf enslavement goes back centuries.,4
"I was telling the truth.” “Ah ... okay,” said Cedric.",4
"“We’ll be on hand if it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the ready.",4
It made his ears shrivel up.” Harry laughed but didn’t voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools.,4
Don’t know when I’ve had more fun.,4
"Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry.",4
“Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please-men turned up — ” Mr. Weasley groaned.,4
"She didn’t look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy.",4
"“We’re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren’t we?” he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.",4
"But I don’t think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don’t know what you’re doing.",4
"... You fight him, boy.",4
"“What?” said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.",4
"“This is really nice of you,” Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley.",4
“And what’s the mirror for?” “Oh that’s my Foe-Glass.,4
"“Winky,” said Hermione firmly, “I’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you.",4
"FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC It seems as though the Ministry of Magic’s troubles are not yet at an end, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent.",4
"He’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament — ” “He’d want you to tell him,” said Hermione sternly.",4
"He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron’s face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, “Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach Jupiter?” “Honestly\” said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away.",4
"Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction.",4
"“What happened to his face?” “Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.",4
"An’ there’s no point tryin’ ter steal any, Goyle,” he added, his beetle-black eyes narrowed.",4
"He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.",4
“Master ... it is beautiful ... thank you ... thank you.,4
“Diggory came back to life?” said Sirius sharply.,4
"Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter.",4
"well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn’t remember that.",4
Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier.,4
"“Amos!” said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted.",4
“You cannot hide from me.,4
"proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters.",4
"He sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through him.",4
"“Harry — we’ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,” said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress.",4
“He’s jealous!” “Jealous?” Harry said incredulously.,4
You must act as you see fit.,4
Sorry if we’ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.” “What are you working on?” said Harry.,4
Over a hundred.” “I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione.,4
"... He’s worried, and he’s tired.",4
...” Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands.,4
"“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all.",4
"“Well, don’t let us hold you up,” Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door.",4
It seemed that Moody’s rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.,4
Neville looked surprised at his own daring.,4
"He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn’t.",4
"Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.",4
"“Let me know, will you?” And he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil’s nose was dead center.",4
They will receive information about the second task when the first is over.,4
"“Got lost!” he mouthed, looking panic-stricken.",4
“Your father’s coming ...” she said quietly.,4
Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache.,4
"maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!” “Oh Ron,” said Hermione, shaking her head sceptically, “we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry’s life, remember?” She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at.",4
"“If you don’t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie, you didn’t get into trouble for it, did you?",4
"Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair.",4
“I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts.,4
"“Looks like they’ve finally found a food they like, doesn’t it?",4
"But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.” Mrs. Weasley nodded.",4
"“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” Snape continued in a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time — ” “I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.",4
Two of the figures were very small.,4
"I don’t want to suffer.” Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry’s eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care.",4
Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face.,4
See you later.” Harry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall.,4
"“The wands connected?” he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore.",4
The police had never read an odder report.,4
"“We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,” Harry muttered.",4
"Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?",4
"Let him go, she said.",4
“Hermione — he’s one of the best Seekers in the world!,4
"“When we get back to the common room tonight, we’ll both have partners — agreed?” “Er ... okay,” said Harry.",4
"Because Rita Skeeter’s still poking around everywhere she can, and I’m willing to bet she’d work up Barty’s illness into something sinister.",4
"Everybody flinched — like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying  Voldemort’s name.",4
"the boy who survived You-Know-Who ... you do know who he is — ” The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.",4
The watching crowd was all murmuring together.,4
"“ ’Bye, Harry!” said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.",4
"Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel — “Impedimental” he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.",4
Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.,4
"the Dumbledore sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day Dumbledore.",4
Harry went down to dinner.,4
"... He’s not very popular in there, I can tell you.",4
I’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes.,4
"“He never even told us, did he?",4
A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on.,4
"“Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,” said Ron scathingly.",4
"“Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries?” “The very same,” said Karkaroff eagerly.",4
"“Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,” he told Harry.",4
"...” Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh — an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.",4
"Harry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly.",4
"For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food .",4
“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief.,4
"Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better- qualified candidates.",4
"“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully to Harry.",4
"“Oh am I?” said Ron, peering down at his predictions.",4
"“I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!” Snape looked up the stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below.",4
"What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like — someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic.",4
"“Curiosity is not a sin,” he said.",4
"They 11 be announcing their engagement any day now.” “Have you had a good summer, Harry?” said Hermione.",4
"... Winky?” he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her.",4
"Harry hurried up alongside them — for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them — and then his mouth fell open.",4
Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused.,4
"The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes.",4
“And I just ... let her carry on a bit.” She smiled even more widely.,4
"Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too.",4
"“I suppose you will, Potter?",4
"This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before.",4
"... Next time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year.",4
She told him a great deal.,4
"Several people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.",4
She just didn’t want to go with Neville ...,4
"“Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly serious.",4
"“Can we buy you a drink?” “Er ... no,” said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, “no, thank you, boys ...” Fred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.",4
"“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel.",4
"See you soon —  Ron “Calm down!” Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person.",4
"Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “He can’t be back, Dumbledore, he just can’t be ...” Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went.",4
"“Arthur, old man,” he puffed as he reached the campfire, “what a day, eh?",4
"When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.",4
This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (“banana fritters”).,4
"It’s almost as though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?” he crowed.",4
"“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.",4
"I’ve been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my braces.",4
"Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray.",4
"“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.",4
"“Oh — yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,” said Harry, grinning.",4
"It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him.",4
“It’s a mast!” he said to Ron and Hermione.,4
"“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice.",4
“Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?” “I’m not asking you to help!” Hermione snapped.,4
"As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me.",4
“He will come upstairs when this class is finished.” Colin went pink.,4
"Harry wished it could have stayed, he could have used some company .",4
"“You haven’t ... she’s not “Oh yes she is,” said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them.",4
“Winky wants to go home.,4
It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.,4
“I don’t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money.,4
It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.,4
"“And after all, Amos ... he died just when he’d won the tournament.",4
Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave.,4
We’ll have to really get down to it tomorrow!,4
"It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them.",4
"“ — it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr. Diggory’s head.",4
"Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale.",4
"Dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression.",4
"“But the task’s not till tonight!” said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.",4
"“She’ll be after you next, Hermione,” said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.",4
Bill came as something of a surprise.,4
"... “That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt — which from her was extravagant praise.",4
"I’m getting out.” He retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.",4
“How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out?,4
"But me — I say there are spots that don’t come off, Snape.",4
Will you go to the ball with me?” Parvati went into a fit of giggles.,4
"“But we should exercise caution with our curiosity ... yes, indeed ...” Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand.",4
"the only way he could keep going was to tell himself, over and over again, next book ...in the next one .",4
"He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he’d slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There’s a Wand, There’s a Way.",4
"... Wormtail, come turn my chair around.” The servant gave a whimper.",4
"“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.",4
"It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before.",4
"“Leprechauns!” said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold.",4
"Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery.",4
"Got me the gamekeeper job ... trusts people, he does.",4
"“Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much  leisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat him down, miss.",4
"I reckon they’ve nearly got the lot, now,” he added, pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive.",4
Was Cedric pulling his leg?,4
"‘Tm afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn’t well, not well at all.",4
"“Hello, Sirius,” said Harry when they had reached him.",4
"“So what did he do in the kitchens?” “Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging.",4
"""... don’t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.” “Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!” Karkaroff’s voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard.",4
"Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.",4
"At last, they were free to go.",4
"There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at  strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s where we’re headed.” Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St. Catchpole.",4
"They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban.",4
The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies.”  “Karkaroff’s gone?,4
"They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite.",4
"“I reckon we can just wait here, you know.",4
Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.,4
"He might write back while I’m here.” He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him .",4
"Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me.",4
Harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified.,4
Does this mean you are tired of our duel?,4
"“I’m not wearing that, no way.” “Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley crossly.",4
"They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage’s Wizarding Crackers.",4
They shot Stunning Spells everywhere.,4
It was hard to believe he was only eighteen.,4
"They’d tell Dumbledore.” Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.",4
"Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — Harry had explained about Aqua- Lungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t Summon one from the nearest Muggle town.",4
"Harry knew these details because he had heard his parents’ voices when he had fought the dementors last year — for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst  memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair.",4
"...” “An old man,” Harry said, his throat still constricted.",4
"“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?” said Fred shrewdly.",4
"Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury.",4
"“Don’t tell me you’re going back to the library this evening?” said Harry, watching her.",4
"...” “Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?” said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.",4
"“There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer’s Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed.",4
"It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to.” “You dropped it on purpose!” roared Mr. Weasley.",4
"His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not.",4
"“Good one, Harry.” “And you,” said Harry, grinning back.",4
"“I really need to see him, it’s urgent!” The gargoyle remained immovable.",4
"... “Potter,” he said quietly.",4
"a IMPEDIMENT A\” The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside.",4
"It was all hushed up, though.",4
"“Wish you would,” said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption.",4
"My Bulgarian opposite number’s making difficulties, and I can’t understand  a word he’s saying.",4
My master had found out that I was still alive.,4
"Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.",4
Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless.,4
I am merely doing my — ” “Who cares if he’s half- giant?” Harry shouted.,4
"Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying.”  “Mmm ... you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?” said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes.",4
"He stood up, and so did Dumbledore.",4
"“Potter ...” he said slowly, “you didn’t happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snape’s office, did you?",4
He supposed he should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects.,4
Could we have asked for more perfect weather?,4
"Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts.",4
"Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns.",4
"Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or rage, he couldn’t tell which.",4
“Harry!” he heard Cedric shouting.,4
"“Don’t worry about it, I’m pretending to be a lovable stray.” He was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harry’s face, said more seriously, “I want to be on the spot.",4
He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took me home.,4
He needed to pass the dragon in the air.,4
"“I mean, how do they expect to get away with it?",4
"Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was carrying an Irish flag.",4
quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble — Hermione and Dobby for a start — there were all the other things he was concealing .,4
The Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn.,4
"“It’s — ” But to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.",4
"Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were.",4
"Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to make himself heard.",4
"He knew that Ron had no idea what he’d walked in on, knew he hadn’t done it on purpose, but he didn’t care — at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.",4
"Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling.",4
"“No, yeh’re not,” said Hagrid.",4
“Mad-Eye didn’t use his wand?,4
"“He’s still ill. Hasn’t been into work.” “Maybe Percy’s poisoning him,” said Ron.",4
"“Winky — hie — is not only — hie — doing housework for Mr. Crouch!” Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse.",4
"Then, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock.",4
"He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider’s pincers on his torn robes.",4
"Bagman gave Harry’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges’ table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said, “Sonorusl” and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.",4
Harry’s head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows.,4
"His head felt clearer; his scar wasn’t hurting so badly; he could now see Moody’s face distinctly, even though the office was  dark.",4
“What’s Malfoy doing?” Harry and Hermione went to see.,4
"Both of us, for instance, had very disappointing fathers ... very disappointing indeed.",4
... Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later.,4
"Fleetingly, and for the first time since he’d found himself champion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school.",4
"After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals.",4
“Surely you’re going to say good-bye?” Uncle Vernon’s face worked furiously.,4
"If you look down at those golden eggs you’re all holding, you will see that they open ... see the hinges there?",4
"Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch.",4
"The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event.",4
"Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum.",4
"Harry couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.",4
"“He can’t be,” said Hermione, “I’ve told you, those sorts of things don’t work around Hogwarts.",4
"“Stop being noble,” said Harry irritably.",4
His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore’s long white hair and beard.,4
"Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.",4
He said it damaged her memory permanently.” “Why is she coming to nose into my master’s private business?” sobbed Winky.,4
The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius.,4
He looked very white and strained.,4
I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.” Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner.,4
Harry scanned the table more carefully.,4
Bit of a strong accent.” “Mr.,4
"Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again.",4
"Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?” “Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning.",4
"There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.",4
"He didn’t care about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.",4
Surely he should have met something by now?,4
A few seconds’ pain and he’d had to blab.,4
"“No,” said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before.",4
The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands.,4
His eyes gazed into Harry’s and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.,4
"To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore.",4
"The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe, reliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer ... Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain, No Stain!",4
"“Who ’re you going with?” “Oh — Cedric,” she said.",4
“I reckon they’re the males.,4
I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning.,4
"As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.",4
"“I’m telling you, that’s not a normal girl!” said Ron, leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her.",4
"“Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” said Harry lightly, folding up the paper.",4
"Horrified, Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into Cedric’s.",4
“ ’S’ matter?” he said.,4
"They could’ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.” “Harry, I don’t understand it either,” said Hermione desperately.",4
"“If you think they can’t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.” “You watch your mouth!” shouted Ron.",4
The Blast- Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate.,4
"But the question is, who did put it in?",4
"He avoided looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins.",4
She took no notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore.,4
"Unfortunately, the Longbottoms’ evidence was — given their condition — none too reliable.” “Then Mr. Crouch’s son might not have been involved?” said Harry slowly.",4
For there had definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground.,4
"Last in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime.",4
"Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.",4
"“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges’ table.",4
"He stared at Harry for a moment, and then said, “Good luck with the third task.”  “Dumbledore reckons You- Know- Who’s getting stronger again as well?” Ron whispered.",4
“If he thought we were standing in the way of his career .,4
“After he’d got rid of his shark’s head.,4
"“Certainly, I believe Harry,” said Dumbledore.",4
“It’s like some sort of ...,4
"He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons — and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament.",4
"“It’s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat?",4
"that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve?”  “You could,” said Dumbledore heavily.",4
"“They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t they?” “Use your brains, Ron,” said Bill.",4
See over there?” He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery  window.,4
When I was abou’ three.,4
The grounds were very dark.,4
"“There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there, Professor?” Moody’s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione.",4
"I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don’t worry.",4
"... One year, and then back to my quiet retirement.”  He gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.",4
"“You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite boy again.",4
That piece of parchment belongs to  Potter.,4
“His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice.,4
"How had Dumbledore known that, at that very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to tell him what had happened?",4
"“Be a talking point, wouldn’t it?”  Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up.",4
"Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.",4
"The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave.",4
"And we ’ave choirs of wood nymphs, ’oo serenade us as we eat.",4
Knows people can turn out okay even if their  families weren’ ... well ... all tha’ respectable.,4
"Theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.",4
Inside was a hastily scribbled note.,4
"Madam Rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing.",4
"“On the contrary,” growled Moody, “it is very important.",4
"But every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic — she was surrounded by friends.",4
Karkaroff drew a deep breath.,4
“Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to break rules.,4
"“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches ... inflexible .",4
"Harry looked around at Krum, who had followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.",4
Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room.,4
"What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledore’s orders, the night that Voldemort had returned?",4
He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.,4
"The four long House tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils.",4
"“Foul\” roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green.",4
“Missing the elephant-man?” There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January.,4
There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he’d last stood on this spot.,4
I gave you to him — the thing he needed above all to regenerate — and then I killed you for him.,4
There were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair .,4
She was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands.,4
See that boy down there?,4
"Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.",4
"Mr. Weasley’s party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts.",4
"If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again.",4
Mr. Crouch is of the opinion .,4
"He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers’ table.",4
They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.,4
The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning.,4
"“If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place.",4
Harry stayed where he was.,4
"“Look!” She pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins.",4
"“House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled squeak.",4
"The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently.",4
"“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly.",4
"“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year.",4
"“Is that — was that Bertha Jorkins?” “Yes,” said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more.",4
"As the girl crossed the Hall, many boys’ heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless, just like Ron.",4
"People were staring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror.",4
"The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display.",4
He did run for it right after the third task.”  George sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.,4
The door swung shut behind them.,4
"“No, no, not at all!",4
“What’s this rubbish about him” — he pointed at Crabbe — “getting a bad bite off a flobberworm?,4
"Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up — Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.",4
"His blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm.",4
"However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.",4
see to the fires and so on.,4
"“Never.” “Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley.",4
"“Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me!",4
Not until Harry felt Wormtail’s anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of him.,4
"“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed.",4
"“Harry, you can’t help him now.",4
"“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.",4
"He began to sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.",4
"“We need to talk,” said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape.",4
"“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,” said Hermione.",4
"There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow.",4
He could feel himself shaking.,4
"Don’t worry,” he added, grinning, spotting the less-than-happy expressions on Harry’s and Cedric’s faces, “you’ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over!",4
“Took me and Cedric to a graveyard ... and Voldemort was there ... Lord Voldemort ...” Clunk.,4
"“Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?” “Yeah, but ... it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.",4
He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch’s son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors.,4
"We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir.",4
“Really?” said Mr. Weasley’s voice excitedly.,4
I was always with the house-elf.,4
“I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear.,4
"that would probably increase a dragon’s firepower ... horn tongue ... just what he needed, to give it an extra weapon .",4
And if he’s not ... what’s he up to?,4
"“When the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table.",4
ten and a quarter inches .,4
"“I thought for a moment — the Dursleys — ” “Hmm,” said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips.",4
"“Never you mind,” she said as though she thought he was being nosy.",4
"“Ill leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,” Hagrid said, staring menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree roots.",4
“Where ’ve you been?” Harry said.,4
Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.,4
So I waited and  watched.,4
Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.,4
"“Well, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives.",4
"It looked as though somebody had been building long, low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every direction.",4
"...” “Great,” said Harry bitterly.",4
"“The champion for Beauxbatons,” said Dumbledore, “is Fleur Delacour!” “It’s her, Ron!” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.",4
"’Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really ... but at least he never saw me expelled.",4
You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — doesn’t that tell you what he’s like?,4
"“You only like him because he’s handsome,” said Ron scathingly.",4
"“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice nervously.",4
"“Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,” said Dumbledore.",4
"Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy’s protection as long as he is in his relations’ care.",4
"Then, from behind them, they heard their names.",4
"I’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.",4
“I’d better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.” “Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?” said Hermione.,4
"... What are we doing, talking  about goblins and Bertha Jorkins?",4
That’s my son\” Harry’s hair stopped blowing about.,4
They looked at one another — it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.,4
"Hermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled Ron’s predictions toward her.",4
“So ... anyway ... enough abou’ me.,4
"The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty.",4
"... A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin.",4
"“What is this thing?” said Moody, drawing the Marauders Map out of his pocket and unfolding it.",4
... and that’s Bode and Croaker ... they’re Unspeakables.,4
Yeah.” Harry looked around the Hall.,4
"“Sorry ... carried away ...” “I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull.",4
"... They’re all ... straight and — and normal-sized.” Hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too: It was a very different smile from the one he remembered.",4
“Who were you talking to?” he said.,4
“Harry’s wand and Voldemort’s wand share cores.,4
Someone set off  the Dark Mark .,4
"“Finally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly.",4
"On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open.",4
"You’ll be supporting Ireland, of course?” she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily.",4
"Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me .",4
Ron’s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.,4
This lot keep gabbling in  Gobbledegook .,4
"He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.",4
"“Dear old Hogwarts,” he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd.",4
"Just as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast.",4
"Viktor Kruml” “For heaven’s sake, Ron, he’s only a Quidditch player,” said Hermione.",4
“I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey.,4
"“Should be right up your street, this one,” said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin.",4
"He said something like, Wormtail’s blunder had been repaired.",4
"“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.",4
"“Which means,” said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry’s face, “that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.” Harry nodded again.",4
"... You’ve gone and stolen a Tri wizard clue, Peeves.",4
"Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn’t hear, and he said, if I wasn’t doing anything over the summer, would I like to — ” “And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione.",4
"Durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do.",4
And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air.,4
"Krum, if you please.” Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, toward Mr. Ollivander.",4
"“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now.",4
Will you come now?” “I’ve already told you!” Hermione said very angrily.,4
"“He offered to help me with the golden egg,” said Harry.",4
"Harry’s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table.",4
"Early next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night.",4
"“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill?",4
“I on’y buried a hundred coins.,4
"“Confident?” “I’m okay,” said Harry.",4
"Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn’t be with him.",4
"... “I WONT!” And these words burst from Harry’s mouth; they echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him — back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body — back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing.",4
"Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.",4
"Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin.",4
"Shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting ... waiting for someone to do something .",4
"“I’ll walk to the edge of the village with you,” said Sirius, “see if I can scrounge another paper.” He transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn ground, and back to the stile.",4
“What are you talking about?” “Mr.,4
"""... Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what-d’you-call-’ems — please-men.",4
"“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?” said Nearly Headless Nick.",4
Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his dustbins.,4
The rest of them followed.,4
"“Well, they’re okay!” said Ron angrily, looking at Harry’s robes.",4
"I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I’m serious.” Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same.",4
“Fred — George — wait a moment.” The twins turned.,4
"“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up.",4
"Blimey,” he said, turning back to Harry, “she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam.",4
"He had got through the first task, he had survived.",4
It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing.,4
"“These’re nifflers,” said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around.",4
Better avoid being hit with it if you can.,4
Harry took that for a “yes.” Harry cast his mind around.,4
"“Harry, come on, move\” Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.",4
"He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three-room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen.",4
"Winky, however, remained  where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying.",4
"Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror.",4
"You just don’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,” said Hermione.",4
"“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.",4
"Then she gulped and said, “I is seeing no one, sir ... no one ...” “Amos,” said Mr. Crouch curtly, “I am fully aware that, in the ordinary course of events, you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning.",4
I’ve seen them at it!,4
"Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe- Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them  all.",4
“He speaks over two hundred!,4
"The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least.",4
"“I don’t know where Barty Crouch is,” Dumbledore told Moody, “but it is essential that we find him.” “I’m onto it,” growled Moody, and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest.",4
“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!,4
"Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.",4
"Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could.",4
"He said — he said he’d be feeding me to it, instead.",4
... They’ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail!,4
“A Muggle and a fool ... very like your dear mother.,4
“He lay there talking to himself for ages about it.,4
"“I’ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I’ll take him — ” “No, I would prefer — ” “Dumbledore, Amos Diggory’s running ... he’s coming over.",4
"If you  want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” He ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard.",4
"Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.",4
“Remember?” she said to Harry and Ron.,4
"“Father ... please ...” “ — that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court,” said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning out his son’s voice.",4
"And he was right — he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.” For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore ’s eyes.",4
His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his wits.,4
"Big bones ... the only thing that’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.” Harry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance.",4
"Continue.” “Well, I had a dream,” said Harry.",4
“Do zey want us back in ze Hall?” She thought he had come to deliver a message.,4
Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.,4
"“I’m not sure this is going to work, you know,” said Hermione warningly “I’m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.” Fred, George, and Lee ignored her.",4
"... Perhaps another little dose of pain?” Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort’s father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him.",4
"Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone in your first year, didn’t you?” “We helped,” Ron said quickly.",4
"Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.",4
“What is it?” she said.,4
"That hurt, didn’t it, Harry?",4
"The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in.",4
Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions.,4
"There might not be time after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last time.”  “Wow — hope it does this time!” said Harry enthusiastically.",4
"“Otherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.” “It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” said Snape softly.",4
"Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry’s shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.",4
"His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn’t been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.",4
"“It’s slavery, that’s what it is!",4
"At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly’s, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, “Quietus.” “They’ll be talking about this one for years,” he said hoarsely, “a really unexpected twist, that.",4
"Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom.",4
"“When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby.",4
and I only know one word of Gobbledegook.,4
Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him.,4
"It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall’s desk (Neville’s still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches”).",4
"Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down.",4
"“Of course,” said Moody, taking a swig from his flask.",4
"“Is there a problem?” he said, looking between Harry and Snape.",4
“I don’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire.,4
“What map is this?” “Potter’s map of Hogwarts.,4
Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak.,4
“I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.” Rita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed.,4
"They’ll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord’s back!",4
"“Would you like a cup of tea?” “Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise.",4
"“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts,” he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry.",4
"When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a quill here somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to —  Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly.",4
It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame.,4
Hermione came over and sat down in Parvati’s empty chair.,4
"He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles.",4
I don’t hear him saying a word.,4
He knows she didn’t do it and he’s still going to sack her!,4
"“Really?” said Rita, apparently full of lively interest.",4
“I saw the Death Eaters!,4
"... Half the Triwizard champions have died ... how long d’you reckon you’re going to last, Potter?",4
They’re having their memories modified right now.” “Death Eaters?” said Harry.,4
"“Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.” “But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?” Harry asked him, grinning.",4
"They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she’d had a job.",4
"“Well ... T>ye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.",4
"“You’re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don’t!” “Leave him alone, Hermione, he’s earned a bit of a break,” said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows.",4
He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line.,4
"“Myrtle, there aren’t merpeople in there, are there?”  “Oooh, very good,” she said, her thick glasses twinkling, “it took Diggory much longer than that!",4
"When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake\ He looked positively delighted about it.",4
"Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house.",4
“Morning!” said Mr. Weasley brightly.,4
"“I’m coming to get you, Peeves.",4
"There was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.",4
His chosen path seemed completely deserted.,4
"He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.",4
"“No, I’m not,” said Hermione, beaming.",4
"“If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves!” said Hermione angrily.",4
"“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.",4
“He said the protection my — my mother left in me — he’d have it too.,4
"...” Harry pulled back the curtains around his four- poster, took his glasses from his bedside table, and put them on.",4
“That’s my wand!” said Harry.,4
"He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail’s anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron.",4
"“The Ministry’s not too happy.” “Ah, why shouldn’t we show our colors?” said Mrs. Finnigan.",4
"For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, “Erm — where are the skrewts?”  “Out by the pumpkin patch,” said Hagrid happily.",4
... You can try out the Wronski Feint.,4
"... And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished.",4
Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns.,4
"“He should be here any moment,” said Dumbledore.",4
"“Can I hear the riddle?” The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited: “First think of the person who lives in disguise, Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.",4
"“Diggory, off you go.” Harry stared apprehensively at Moody.",4
"For one shining moment, he saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it.",4
"In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra- squiggly, golden television aerial.",4
"and this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman’s.",4
"Harry — did you see Voldemort?” “No,” said Harry.",4
Ron would be sitting with him.,4
"knew, because the woman was the one he’d thought of more than any other tonight.",4
"“Harry, that’s their idea of fun.",4
"“Percy won’t’ve had time to answer yet,” said Ron.",4
"“You are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school.",4
Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred.,4
"Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, “They’re very interesting, aren’t they?",4
"“And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!”  Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands.",4
"The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face.",4
"His voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time.",4
"“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes.",4
"“Madame Maxime!” said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress.",4
"“He could have really hurt Malfoy, though,” she said.",4
"Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these wouldn’t hurt anyone if they went off target.",4
"His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain.",4
"He could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if he didn’t like it; they had their own champion to support.",4
Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said.,4
"next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I’ve heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity.",4
Harry was getting sick of telling people that Hermione wasn’t his girlfriend.,4
"I really wanted to ask you” — he lowered his voice — “how are you getting on with your golden egg?” “Er ... not bad,” Harry said untruthfully.",4
"“They’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.” “Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly now.",4
"“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.",4
Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet.,4
“Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could’ve gotten down to the forest?,4
I was not to be assured immortal life.,4
"It’s been in the Daily Prophet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything.",4
...” He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.,4
The entrance hall rang with laughter.,4
"All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.",4
"When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in.",4
"“No, you didn’t,” he said.",4
"His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behaving.",4
"Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harry’s bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry.",4
"“I’m going to bed,” Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls’ staircase without another word.",4
...” Madame Maxime didn’t say anything.,4
"Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth — he looked hardly older than eleven.",4
“Tell him what has happened.,4
"For — for his own safety.” “Ah, I see,” said Moody softly.",4
Mr. Crouch too has disappeared ... within these very grounds.,4
“Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?”  Hermione looked at him in surprise.,4
“What?” Harry looked around; the whole class was staring at him.,4
"“Fighting the Dark Arts,” said Fred.",4
“Not bad!” said Ron as the crowd applauded.,4
"And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance — well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught  fire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand.",4
"“Isn’t he vith your Ministry?” Harry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree.",4
"“I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again ... and again ... and again ...”  Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered, tasseled program.",4
"“They are now,” said Hermione in an exasperated voice, “but once Hagrid’s found out what they eat, I expect they’ll be six feet long.” “Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it?” said Ron, grinning slyly at her.",4
"He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time.",4
"“Minerva,” said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, “I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible.",4
"It happened, there, in the Top Box.",4
"Harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.",4
I haven’t seen one that convincing in years!,4
...” Moody’s wand was still pointing directly at Harry’s heart.,4
Harry saw Cedric’s wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.,4
A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap — Neville almost always forgot to pack something.,4
"But when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded.",4
"I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards.",4
"“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said Hermione fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd.",4
"“And it’s not spew, Ron — ” “Changed the name, have you?” said Ron, frowning at her.",4
"“About time!” said Harry, hurrying after her.",4
"“Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,” said Filch at once.",4
"And Winky here had the  misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up.” “But then, she’d have been only a few feet away from the real culprit!” said Mr. Diggory impatiently.",4
People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire.,4
"“What are you two up to?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins.",4
"“And now I want to ask you a question, Potter,” said Moody in a more businesslike tone.",4
"“Ah, right,” said Mr. Weasley.",4
"“Yeah, well, Percy wouldn’t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he?” said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair.",4
"“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.",4
Where were Fleur and Krum?,4
"It was a different memory, a different day ... a different trial.",4
Did it take you ages to find us?” “No ...,4
"“Harry, well done!” Hermione cried.",4
He agreed in the end.,4
"He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table.",4
’Magine lettin’ him lure yeh off on yer own — ” “Krum’s all right!” said Harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall.,4
“Are you all right?” Crouch’s eyes were rolling in his head.,4
"They were very relieved to get out at King’s Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.",4
"The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry’s bed.",4
The start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was training hard for the last  Quidditch match of the season.,4
"“I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday,” Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.",4
Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite.,4
"So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.",4
“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.,4
"Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face.",4
And there’s nothing wrong with me!,4
"Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?”  “Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,” said Bill patiently.",4
"“No,” said Harry, “missed.” “LEAVE IT!” Moody shouted.",4
"I will be his dearest, his closest supporter ... closer than a son.",4
"“Harry ...” whispered the figure of Cedric, “take my body back, will you?",4
"Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.",4
"Good night to you all.” “An Age Line!” Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall.",4
The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.,4
The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron’s and Hermione ’s part.,4
"Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished.",4
"The boys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, “The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch!",4
"“Sir is very kind!” he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron.",4
"Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry’s House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents’ tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team.",4
He recognized the goatee ... it was Karkaroff.,4
"“Avada Kedavra’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it — you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I’d get so much as a nosebleed.",4
"“I don’t know what’s going to happen to them, I really don’t.",4
"His team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots.",4
"However, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady.",4
what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar.,4
"When they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight.",4
"what, excuse me?” “Well — you know,” said Ron, shrugging.",4
"“What’s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?” said Fred at once.",4
"Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.",4
He was talking about it without any kind of remorse — with amusement.,4
Why doesn’t Dobby and Winky find work together?’ Dobby says.,4
Beat ’em all.” Lying to Hagrid wasn’t quite like lying to anyone else.,4
"“That’s better,” panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses.",4
"The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his  scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.",4
"Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to Harry’s great surprise (and Ron’s and Hermione’s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again.",4
"Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione.",4
"“It is back,” he said softly, “they will all have noticed it ... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...” He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail’s arm.",4
"One, who I believe has left me forever ... he  will be killed, of course ... and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.” The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks.",4
They looked at each other.,4
They went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle.,4
"Now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledore’s safety precautions wouldn’t have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn’t turned up.",4
"Who is to milk Nagini?” “But you seem so much stronger, My Lord — ” “Liar,” breathed the second voice.",4
"Maybe this is the task they’re going to get you.” “Look,” said Harry impatiently, “let’s say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch.",4
"Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too.",4
"“I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook.",4
"“It’s all right,” he said.",4
"He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified.",4
Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.,4
"“He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,” said Sirius.",4
"Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs — he had taken his hands off his Firebolt — he had seized the golden egg — And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up — for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup — “Look at that!” Bagman was yelling.",4
"He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.",4
"They might already have the letter, I don’t know how fast Muggle post is.",4
Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now.,4
"The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney’s rambling talks on fortune- telling never held him exactly spellbound — though he couldn’t help thinking about what she had just said to him.",4
"Then she leapt to her feet, said, “See you at dinner!” and departed at high speed.",4
"...” But already, yet another head was emerging .",4
Dumbledore wouldn’t have let any of us drown!” “The song said — ” “It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!” said Ron.,4
"“I had my birthday last week,” said Angelina.",4
"They were not enslaved, as I was.",4
"The trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn’t done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg.",4
Dumbledore wouldn’t ignore him like that.,4
"There was a thickset man who stared blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-  looking man, whose eyes were darting around the crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified.",4
“Where is Hermione?” he said again.,4
"By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood.",4
Many of your families have been torn asunder.,4
"A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field.",4
Harry was only half listening.,4
"Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other’s beards.",4
He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up.,4
"Looking down, Harry saw the headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.",4
"He can’t avoid us forever.” “Who’s avoiding you?” said Ron, sitting down next to them.",4
"“I now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!” He sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation.",4
"Why didn’t he just let him die?” “I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out — ” “What d’you think, Sirius?” Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen.",4
"Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he pointed at it.",4
“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon.,4
"I was myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in years.” “And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?” said Dumbledore.",4
"He didn’t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn’t see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes.",4
"“They organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn’t they?” said Hermione.",4
That’s what’s normal for wizards.” Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting swear word.,4
Lee Jordan’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well.,4
“A creature I wouldn’t want to kiss ... a spiderl” The sphinx smiled more broadly.,4
"Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid!",4
"Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.",4
"“Why isn’t she leaving us be?” “Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,” said Dumbledore.",4
"Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls.",4
"Tiny little bloke, my dad was.",4
"The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong.",4
"Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century.",4
“But maybe he doesn’t care ... it’d probably just make him admire Crouch even more.,4
"There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously.",4
It put its long snout in Harry’s ear and sniffed enthusiastically.,4
Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look.,4
"“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back.",4
"Well, I’m sure you’ll find someone somewhere who’ll have you.” But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.",4
Potter believed my father was after Snape.,4
Bagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.,4
She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl.,4
"“Well, they’re Apparating, aren’t they?” said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls.",4
...” And he came .,4
Karkaroff hovered behind Snape ’s desk for the rest of the double period.,4
"“Arthur — I’ve been so worried — so worried — ” She flung her arms around Mr. Weasley’s neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground.",4
"I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is.",4
"What I was, even I do not know ...",4
"“But it’s gonna be spectacular, I’ll tell yeh that.",4
I thought I was collecting information for our side!,4
"He was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn’t asking where he’d got it, and there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favor.",4
She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation.,4
Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before — he was the wand-maker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.,4
"“Hate to break it to you, Potter.",4
"So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible.",4
"It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.",4
"He said you were incredible against the Horntail.” Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother’s shoulder.",4
"Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the  ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake.",4
"“Because I want to fix that in my memory forever,” said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face.",4
"“Hagrid, no\” Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.",4
“And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms .,4
Bill’s table caught Charlie’s with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off.,4
"“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley.",4
what are you saying?” said Harry slowly.,4
"“ ’E ’as ze chance to compete, ’asn’t ’e?",4
Harry got to his feet to face them.,4
They didn’t see a sign of him all week.,4
"As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn’t bothered, was soon tugging on Harry’s arm.",4
"“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come.",4
"How could you say something like that — I want Harry to win the tournament, Harry knows that, don’t you, Harry?” “You’ve got a funny way of showing it,” sneered Ron.",4
And Harry — I want you to stay there.,4
"Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.",4
"He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.",4
"Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such a Mudblood-lover — and Durmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of riffraff.",4
"Apparently Fred and George’s plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public.",4
"“Right,” said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts.",4
must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail.,4
It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention.,4
I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion.,4
"I’m telling you, I’m not going to win any races on this leg.” Cedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the cup, shaking his head.",4
The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of light.,4
It leaves me free to talk to you normally.,4
He wondered how the other champions were feeling.,4
"He had distinctly heard the words “Ministry of Magic,” “wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in  code: spies and criminals.",4
"“He’s not at all like you’d think, coming from Durmstrang.",4
"“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr. Crouch.",4
"It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.",4
"Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, “He is wanting paying for his work, sir.” “Paying?” said Harry blankly.",4
"“Normal for us,” said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, “you know, owl post.",4
"Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything.",4
"“No respect ...” Ludo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.",4
"Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.",4
“A dream about Lord Voldemort.,4
"In Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself.",4
The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him.,4
"Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office ... nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above.",4
We both knew he had returned.,4
Got to be careful ...” Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him.,4
"Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie’s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off.",4
They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down.,4
"Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns.",4
“But I’ll tell you this ... it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it.,4
It fluttered every time she snored.,4
"He could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water.",4
"He took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and  hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight.",4
"Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he’d been using sign language all day for nothing.",4
"“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very successful.",4
"“Lost her, have you?” Krum was looking surly again.",4
"Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good- byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy, and the girls.",4
"“Yes, yes, let’s go down to the grounds, then,” said Fudge impatiently.",4
“That’s if he hasn’t been attacked by his skrewts.,4
“He risked his own life to return Cedric’s body to Hogwarts.,4
We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.,4
"Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys’ snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o’clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.",4
"“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry said blankly.",4
"He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely.",4
"“Oops — sorry, ’Arry — ” He swallowed.",4
"Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.",4
"Wha’ ’appened?” said Harry, through a sizable chunk of steak.",4
"From the looks on everyone’s faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider.",4
"Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up Dudley’s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.",4
"“You’ll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have had their say.” “Huh?” said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field.",4
"“Hmm,” said Sirius, looking thoughtful.",4
"Dead).” “Harry, let go of him,” he heard Fudge’s voice say, and he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric’s limp body, but Harry wouldn’t let him go.",4
“ ‘Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you.,4
"He’d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.” “Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,” said Hermione severely.",4
And I wasn’t the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial.,4
"He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley’s there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you.",4
"“Once the shock’s worn off, and she’s got used to Hogwarts, she’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.” “She seems to love him,” said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake) .",4
"At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor.",4
But you did not ... you did not.,4
This belongs to a school champion!” Harry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast — “PEEVES!” Filch roared gleefully.,4
“What the hell d’you think you’re doing?” And then Harry heard Krum’s voice.,4
"“The youngest champion, you know ... to add a bit of color?” “Certainly!” cried Bagman.",4
I can give you their names!,4
"The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.",4
"An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrid’s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight.",4
Because Hermione ’s not my girlfriend.” “Oh!” said Mrs. Weasley.,4
"“The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.",4
It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it.,4
"“Your mum doesn’t read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?” she asked quietly.",4
"“The Hogwarts champion,” he called, “is Cedric Diggory!” “No!” said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great.",4
"Six dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four people.",4
"But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are taking me, ’Agrid?”  “Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seem’, trust me.",4
"Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.",4
"He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first- floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.",4
"Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles’ bodies came back and changed everything.",4
"Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance.",4
"Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric Diggoryl badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight.",4
"“She was a foot taller than me,” said Harry, still unnerved.",4
"“She’s lying,” said Ron flatly, watching her go.",4
"“I want you to come up to my office first, Harry,” he said quietly as they headed up the passageway.",4
"“On three, right?” said Harry.",4
“I reckon he’ll know your name soon.”  Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.,4
"Well, off you go, then!” Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail.",4
“Should I go and get someone?” said Harry.,4
"... Yeah, I’m staying just the one year.",4
"This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.",4
"What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet.",4
"The match became still faster, but more brutal.",4
"He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore’s office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream.",4
Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand.,4
It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off.,4
"Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Ron’s dress robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion.",4
"I don’t think any student could have done it ... they’d never be able to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore ’s — ” “Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted.",4
“Ministry blunders ... culprits not apprehended ... lax security ...,4
"... “Er,” he said, “Mr.",4
HarryV’ He opened his eyes.,4
"“Did he eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his feet.",4
"“Just ignore it, Harry.” But Harry couldn’t ignore it.",4
I bet you anything these kids’ll know soon enough anyway.,4
He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever.,4
Harry started unwrapping the shopping.,4
"“Sirius Black!” she shrieked, pointing at him.",4
"I expect more faithful service in the future.” “Of course, my Lord, of course.",4
"and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.” They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible.",4
"He seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron’s robes, and kicked off from the bottom.",4
"The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.",4
"Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man’s face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction.",4
"The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet.",4
"I’ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.” Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room.",4
She had let me acquire a wand.,4
Hedwig didn’t return until the end of the Easter holidays.,4
"“All these yours, Arthur?” “Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.",4
"Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, “Come on, Ron, it could be worse.",4
Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss.,4
"However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,” Voldemort’s red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, “a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided ...",4
"Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions.",4
"And I think you know his son, Cedric?” Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen.",4
“And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we’d had our conversation by the lake.,4
"“It’s Mr. Crouch ... he’s just turned up ... he’s in the forest ... he’s asking — ” “What is this rubbish?” said Snape, his black eyes glittering.",4
“My master came for me.,4
"“Jus’ give us a sec.” Hagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it.",4
"On the count of three, then.",4
"“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she said.",4
"Harry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it.",4
"It’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you!",4
"Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory’s mouth.",4
"Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.",4
"“Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a moment.",4
“He fancies her!” said Ron incredulously.,4
"“Well, if you don’t like it, you know what the solution is, don’t you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger.",4
They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup.,4
"“Good-bye!” The house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs.",4
"... “The lake!” yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it.",4
"He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort’s father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist.",4
"Better get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to be around much longer.",4
"I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name .",4
"Immediately, the world righted itself.",4
"...” Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup.",4
"With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.",4
“He’s going up to the castle with her!” said Hermione indignantly.,4
“How did she find out?” he whispered.,4
"The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King’s Cross .",4
"Twas Gryffindor who found the way, He whipped me off his head The founders put some brains in me So I could choose instead!",4
Cedric was pacing up and down.,4
"Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.",4
"The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his heels.",4
"“It’s coming back ... Karkaroff’s too ... stronger and clearer than ever ...” “A connection I could have made without assistance,” Dumbledore sighed, “but never mind.” He peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who was gaping at Snape’s face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl.",4
"The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told them.",4
"“What is it, Vernon?” But they were left in doubt barely a second longer.",4
"It was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn’t seem to have any insides at all.",4
"“Dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor.",4
"When he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve.",4
“Don’ yeh like it?” “Is that aftershave?” said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.,4
“ ‘Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache .,4
"“Now, see here, Dumbledore,” he said, waving a threatening finger.",4
"“Good afternoon,” he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.",4
"“Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!” Dobby squealed excitedly.",4
Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog.,4
"Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year — ” “That’ll change the world, that report will,” said Ron.",4
...” Hagrid’s deep voice broke.,4
"He then pointed his wand at it and muttered, “Imperio\” The spider leapt from Moody’s hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze.",4
"“Where?” spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whiskey.",4
“I was wondering who was making all the noise.,4
"They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric, and Fleur had disappeared.",4
"He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, “So — yer competin’, Harry.",4
“You’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and  you don’t even know ?,4
"“He’s very upset,” said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around.",4
“But he can’t be that ill if he managed to get up here.,4
The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry.,4
"He had let Harry talk himself into silence without interruption, but now he said, “Dragons we can deal with, Harry, but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long here ... I’ve broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time.",4
"His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more.",4
"Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed.",4
"That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else’s memory ... and unless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again.",4
But I must keep an eye out for it.,4
"“We’re playing against each other again!” “I s’pose,” said Harry.",4
"...” “But he’s right, Harry,” said Hermione, “you have still got two tasks to do.",4
They had explained away Harry’s long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.,4
"“If I thought I could help you,” Dumbledore said gently, “by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it.",4
“But I’m not the only one who knows.,4
"At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.",4
She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her.,4
Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page.,4
"“Give it to me!” But she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick, laughing at him.",4
"“But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure.",4
"He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes.",4
"Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of half-bow that made him look like a hunchback.",4
"“She just picked it up off the ground!” “Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?” said Ron impatiently.",4
“D’you think ... could this have anything to do with .,4
"“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said Bagman brightly.",4
They’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time.,4
"“If you don’t know,” said Ron scathingly, “I’m not going to tell you.” Hermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.",4
There was a soft rush of wings.,4
"Hey, Weasley!” Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned.",4
“Ah — right — certainly — ” said Mr. Weasley.,4
"As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron.",4
"Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual.",4
but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort’s wand ... and slowly ... very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment... and then it connected.,4
"Yeh’re goin’ ter win, Harry.” Harry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid ’s face.",4
"“It’s a sport,” he said shortly.",4
"His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.",4
"But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his “er’s” into long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.",4
"“Now we just need the Portkey,” said Mr. Weasley, replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground.",4
"I’m not botherin’ with her no more, I promise yeh that.",4
"Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred and George, he hadn’t really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened.",4
"“He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play.",4
"“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t afford a house-elf who’s going to run amok with a wand!” said Percy pompously, recovering himself.",4
"“The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all!",4
"However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own.” Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, half-commiserating looks.",4
"Where have the others got to?” Fred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite.",4
"This was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness.",4
But Aunt Petunia didn’t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs.,4
"One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.",4
"Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village.",4
"Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.",4
"She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too.",4
"“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.",4
but would it be good enough?,4
“I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad didn’t make him.,4
"“It didn’t sound anything like Winky, did it?” “No,” said Harry, shaking his head.",4
He retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him.,4
"Vanishes after a few hours.” Goyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky.",4
"“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his stupid ship?” said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books.",4
"“Should be a good do, I reckon.",4
"Those holding Harry loosened their grip, staring behind them.",4
"“Worthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me .",4
"I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences — here’s what I think of you!” Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet.",4
"With a meaningful look at both of them he said, “All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?” “Yeah ... think I will too,” said Ron at once.",4
... “Oh I’m not sure that was wise!” they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully.,4
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway.",4
"The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.” Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room.",4
"“Ron, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?” George asked.",4
"Let’s just see what’s inside it!” “He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said swiftly.",4
"We held a ghost’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down.” The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains.",4
"“I think so,” said Harry.",4
"Several seats down from them, Fred and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.",4
“Oh ... yeah ... right ...” It was an odd moment.,4
"Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible.",4
He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to.,4
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward.",4
The smallest of frowns creased Bagman’s smooth face.,4
The crowd was making even more noise.,4
"“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street.",4
“The expert’s upstairs now with Dumbledore.,4
"... All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, “ Expelliarmus” ... and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one?",4
“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers.,4
“It was ze grindylows .,4
"You’ll be openin’ the dancin’, won’ yeh, Harry?",4
“Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!” Bagman shouted.,4
"“Well,” said Sirius slowly, “I wouldn’t put it past Mad- Eye to have searched every single teacher’s office when he got to Hogwarts.",4
"Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.",4
"He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large.",4
"A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.",4
“Hagrid’s Blast-Ended Skrewts!” he hissed.,4
“He told me after Potions!,4
"“A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail — though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?” “I — I thought she might be useful, My Lord — ” “Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever.",4
“We were going to do the Impediment Curse!,4
"“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward.",4
"Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania.",4
"“I will not fit into my dress robes!” “Oooh there’s a tragedy,” Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance hall.",4
"Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were  whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria’s first goal.",4
"“Its proper name is Pigwidgeon.” “Yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,” said Ron sarcastically.",4
"“Harry, come on, they’re waiting for you!” Utterly perplexed, Harry got up.",4
"Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.",4
"“If you don’t take it, I’m throwing it down the drain.",4
"“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, “and wait for your turn, Potter.",4
“Thought we’d jus’ try an’ see if they fancied a kip ... we’ll jus’ settle ’em down in these boxes.,4
“Just the back of his chair.,4
"“I just need to — sort of fine-tune it, all right?” He, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves.",4
"Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.",4
He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him.,4
"“We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details — ” “Oh details!” said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges.",4
"Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.",4
"Silencel” Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once.",4
"“Where have you been?” said a bossy, disapproving voice.",4
"Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on every other step.",4
"He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly.",4
"“Last year’s Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left now, but it looks as though Montague’s replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well.",5
"“Dumbledore was relyin’ on us!” “But you’ve just said there was no way you could go back!” “Not by daylight, we couldn’, no.",5
"’ There will be no need to talk.” Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk.",5
"He shouted “Protego\” before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it.",5
"“Let’s try again...” He moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions.",5
"Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, was unavailable for comment last night.",5
"The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry’s indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful.",5
"“And you too, Dilys!” A sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately.",5
"Harry was filled alternately with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them for  leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.",5
Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room.,5
"He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake.",5
"“Have a good term, okay?” “Look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last.",5
"Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine.",5
"“I don’t believe it,” said Phineas brusquely.",5
“I know.” The dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in.,5
"“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely nonplussed.",5
"WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!",5
"He had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room.",5
Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?” Harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach.,5
"All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say “yeah” and “that’s right” whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.",5
"“Didn’ speak English.” “You’re kidding!” “Didn’ matter,” said Hagrid imperturbably, “Dumbledore had warned us tha’ migh’ happen.",5
"“You always get away with stuff!” “They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes.",5
"His eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.",5
There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals.,5
"She also” — Sirius’s eyes turned to the other two — “advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart.",5
"“Good to see you!” Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.",5
“Gran’s always telling Professor Marchbanks I’m not as good as my dad... Well ... you saw what she’s like at St. Mungo’s...” Neville looked fixedly at the floor.,5
"“Anyway, Harry, you’re interfering with reception.",5
There was an envelope in her hand.,5
"“Still, better than D, isn’t it?",5
"I turned him down, though.” Harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this.",5
"“Sleep tight,” said Fred, winking.",5
“About what happened to me last June.” For some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this.,5
Umbridge’s slack face seemed to tighten.,5
The sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold.,5
"“They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he’s alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a  good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis...” Harry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night.",5
"Ron, I’m so proud of you, what wonderful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s the first step!",5
"“WEVE GOT HIM!” yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, “IN AN OFFICE OFF — ”  “ Silenciol ” cried Hermione, and the man’s voice was extinguished.",5
"“It’s got my name on,” said Harry.",5
"“Hagrid might have set it off accidentally.” “Yes,” said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting.",5
Harry realized at once that she was right: He could no sooner have picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-black floor.,5
"“You had to act like Muggles all the way?” “Well, not exactly all the way,” said Hagrid cagily.",5
"We lost Moody’s spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung’s been dressing as a witch a lot lately...",5
His scar began to burn; he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise.,5
"But when Educational Decree Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I’ll be allowed to do them things... And she’s asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves... Oh, things are going to be very different around here with her in charge...” Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school’s secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley twins.",5
"“Who ’re you after?” he asked it, languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipient’s name and address: Harry Potter Great Hall Hogwarts School Frowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter, knocking over the salt, and each attempting to give him their letters first.",5
"Anyway, we’re having a practice session at two o’clock tomorrow, so just make sure you’re there this time.",5
"Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, “EXPELLIARMUS\” Both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and  Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrors truck at what he had done.",5
"“I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag.” “Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn’t it?” said Hermione pleasantly.",5
"“What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry’s body in  turn, apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most.",5
The noble blood that runs in my veins — ”  “What blood?” asked Ron.,5
"She was simply standing there, crying silently.",5
"“Your dad,” he panted, his chest heaving.",5
It had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there.,5
"He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it —  He looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty.",5
"Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.",5
"“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George.",5
"“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.",5
"“He was fine when I was practicing with him this morning.” “Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon,” said Fred gloomily.",5
"There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.",5
"“Well, it’s cold out there!” she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently.",5
"But then Voldemort’ s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that... And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is insane — if Voldemort’s possessing me, I’m giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now!",5
"“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron.",5
They had wasted so much time — they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision.,5
"“But you will fetch it for me first, Black... You think you have felt pain thus far?",5
The door slammed behind them and Mrs. Black’s screeches were cut off instantly.,5
It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air.,5
"“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously...” “We’ve been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray...” “We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here...” “There’s a fair  amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you...” But when were they going to see him?",5
"“Cornelius ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge, that’s what his friends call him, if you could hear him when he thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always talking about the goblins he’s had done in; he’s had them drowned, he’s had them dropped off buildings, he’s had them poisoned, he’s had them cooked in pies...” Harry did not read any further.",5
"It was really good, wasn’t it?” The subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates.",5
But the fact remained that if he were caught .,5
James’s free hand jumped to his hair again.,5
"“You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s sake.” She was staring at the common room notice board, where a large new sign had been put up.",5
"“The Malfoy boy cornered him.” “Did he, did he?” said Fudge appreciatively.",5
"“Hermione, wake up...” “Whaddid he do to her?” said Neville, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose.",5
"“Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter’s owl!” said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face.",5
"Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don’t be silly, girl, they won’t hurt you — and hand one to each student — ” “Hem, hem,” said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term.",5
He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it.,5
“What’s she doing back here?,5
"“No I’m not, you’ve beaten me in every test — ” “Actually, I haven’t,” said Hermione coolly.",5
"“The ones with any sense were keepin’ outta Golgomath ’s way, hidin’ out in caves roun’ the gully jus’ like we were.",5
"“I got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes, and the tufted tail,” he said anxiously, “but I couldn’t think what else — ” “How thick are you, Wormtail?” said James impatiently.",5
"“Find someone who cares, why don’t you?” “They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,” said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, “How has that made you feel, Harry?",5
"“Come on, you can tell me!",5
"“We’re going to do it anyway, of course,” he said quietly.",5
"“No,” said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue.",5
Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk.,5
"For a few moments, the only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors.",5
He felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment...,5
"“Well start with the Impediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.” They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual.",5
"“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once.",5
"“And listen ...” He lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “Harry, I know you don’t like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we all — Sirius included — want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?” “Yeah, all right,” said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin’s prematurely lined face.",5
"“I’ve never been able to Stun anything before.” “Thanks,” said Harry awkwardly.",5
"“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin.",5
"Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo’s.",5
"“I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy’s imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!” said Fudge.",5
Blacks screeches started up again from down below.,5
"“Oh I see,” said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard.",5
They were bound to write back quickly; they couldn’t possibly ignore a dementor attack.,5
"“O’ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin’ accidents, aren’ they?” He adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising.",5
"“All righ’, Grawpy?” said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again.",5
"It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that’s a record for you, isn’t it?” Fred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.",5
“They’re brains.” “Brains?” “Yes ...,5
"“But Harry Potter does not seem happy,” Dobby went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry.",5
"“Very well, then,” said Fudge, now radiant with glee.",5
"“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him.",5
The Ministry of Magic must be full of workers... How would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen?,5
"Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them; soon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak.",5
"“You’re — you’re a witch?” “I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was I supposed to help you fight off dementors?",5
They would have known he’d been sent to steal the weapon.,5
"It was sunny and the grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include, or end in, murder...",5
And the night before we came back to Hogwarts ...” He thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron’s bedroom in Grimmauld Place.,5
"“I’m sure you are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved ‘Outstanding’ in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to — er — ‘bring me in’ by force, I will have to hurt you.” The man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish.",5
He looked quickly around at Sirius for support.,5
"Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and forward, clutching her sides.",5
"’ ” “Why?” said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk.",5
"The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.” Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back.",5
"“This is it, then, isn’t it?” said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open.",5
"“Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,” he said softly.",5
"“Have you not been listening, Dumbledore?",5
"Sturgis had Moody’s Invisibility Cloak, right?",5
"Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, “Parkinson, Pansy — Patil, Padma — Patil, Parvati — Potter, Harry.” “Good luck,” said Ron quietly.",5
He supposed none of them would want him there anymore now that they knew what was inside him...,5
"“The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!” “Thank you, Fortescue, that will do,” said Dumbledore softly.",5
"The recent blow on the back of Harry’s head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again.",5
"“No way,” said George in a hushed voice.",5
"“Well, that’s okay then, the person I’m asking about is a wizard.",5
"If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours.",5
"“STOP THEM!” shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late.",5
"“You know what Sirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free!” “It isn’t clothes,” said Hermione, “although if I had my way I’d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag.",5
"“Hagrid,” she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, “who is he?” Harry found this an odd question... “What is it?” was the one he had been planning on asking.",5
"Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking.",5
Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.,5
"“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in... Arthur, I don’t want this lot up too late, all right?",5
"As the train slowed down in the approach to King’s Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less.",5
"“Where have you been?” said Hermione anxiously, springing up.",5
She got to her feet again.,5
"He wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of provoking Harry.",5
"“We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong.” “If you’re talking about Lupin ...” Harry began.",5
"“Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron!” She left.",5
"“And now Rookwood’s told Voldemort how to get the weapon?” “I didn’t hear all the conversation, but that’s what it sounded like,” said Harry.",5
His breathing seemed difficult again.,5
Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date.,5
“Hogwarts has got a whole herd of ’em in here.,5
"I — ” “I said shut up!” Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right.",5
"“Wonderfully ingenious.” “They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the sign.",5
Now don’t forget to keep your voices down in the hall.,5
"Umbridge gave her wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed.",5
"He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him.",5
"An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps.",5
"There was something in this room he wanted very, very much... Something he wanted... or somebody else wanted... His scar was hurting.",5
"Kept ’emselves to ’emselves, bu’ always turned up if I wanted a word.",5
"“Wotcher, Harry,” she said, winking.",5
"“It’s only my ankle, I can do it myself!” said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support.",5
Percy came home and told us he’d been promoted.” “You’re kidding?” said Harry.,5
"“Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d respond, after all, you are the only member of his family he’s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said — ” “So what are Umbridge’s lessons like?” Sirius interrupted.",5
"A tingling sensation was spreading throughout him, paralyzing his arms, legs, and brain.",5
"“Who’s that for anyway?” he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.",5
"Harry pulled Ron’s arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley’s.",5
He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve.,5
"“He’s too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that’s not nearly often enough.” “Who, then?” said Harry, frowning at her.",5
"“Control your anger, discipline your mind!",5
"He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes.",5
A great wave of relief broke over Harry.,5
Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps.,5
"Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?”  Marietta nodded.",5
"“You need more persuasion?” she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly.",5
“We entered your third year.,5
"“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in the blackness.",5
"He’s still alive, he’s still fighting, I can feel it...",5
"“Nah, I don’ reckon he did,” he said quietly.",5
"“Don’t be thick,” said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.",5
"“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and still not looking at her.",5
"Fred fell into a doze, his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder.",5
"His hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbors, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped.",5
"“Is she training you all to kill half- breeds?”  “No,” said Harry, ignoring Hermione’s affronted look at being cut off in her defense of Kreacher.",5
“In a few hours’ time you’ll be cleared.” Harry said nothing.,5
"Hermione, however, gave a gasp.",5
"“Angelina still won’t let him resign,” Ginny said, as though reading Harry’s mind.",5
"“You thought wrong,” she said, turning her back on Umbridge.",5
"Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm as though frightened the floor might move too, but it did not.",5
“You don’t get it!” Harry shouted at her.,5
"He had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place.",5
"“Where ’d you get that?” “Nicked it,” said James casually.",5
"1VO!” He could hear girls’ voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care, not until somebody in the vicinity yelled “ IMPEDIMENTA !” and only when he was knocked over backward by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach... “What do you think you’re doing?” screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet again; it was she who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx.",5
"Hagrid deposited his half a cow with a grunt on the ground, stepped back, and turned to face his class again, most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to tree, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment.",5
"What are you hiding here for?” “I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,” said Ron.",5
"“He’s ill, Vernon!” “What is it, son?",5
He had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it.,5
"Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a hard lump rise in his throat.",5
"The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving.",5
"Now, come on, quick.” He took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, across the road, and onto the pavement.",5
"“Excuse me?” “Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that’ll open any lock,” said Harry.",5
"“Master has gone out, Harry Potter.” “Where’s he gone?",5
He would hear them before he saw them... “I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered.,5
There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked; Malfoy was still circling the stadium just like Harry.,5
"“Just an idea, thought you might like to get together — ” “I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban!” said Harry.",5
"“It’s probably full of nargles, though.” “What are nargles?” “No idea,” said Harry.",5
I want to know what’s going on and when I’m going to get out of here.,5
"Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the time of the — ” “We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!” snarled Fudge.",5
For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard.,5
"Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life... What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear?",5
Just to — er — give me some practice before training?,5
How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor?,5
"“You can’t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer...” He bent and picked up his Potions book.",5
"“Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?” “Yeah, we were just wondering that,” said a familiar voice from behind her.",5
"“Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered George, as the three of them landed at the  crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.",5
The poster (“By Order of the Ministry of Magic”) offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.,5
Are you ready?” he called down the row.,5
The rest’ll be circling us.,5
"“What is it?” “Stay where you are.” “I haven’t moved!” said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob.",5
"“I’d rather have the nightmares!” They were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived there next morning.",5
They all looked at Harry.,5
Why I had not so much as looked at you for months?”  Harry looked up.,5
“Where are we going anyway?” Harry asked.,5
"“What’s going on?” Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forward to watch as another seven owls landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.",5
Neville had improved beyond all recognition.,5
"“Oh, Harry,” she said sadly.",5
"“An’ you too, Neville, eh?",5
"“How are yeh, Magorian?” said Hagrid warily.",5
"The name had stirred something in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn’t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach.",5
"“Probably woulda done if they’d bin in any condition,” said Hagrid, “but they was badly hurt, all three o’ them.",5
At last Harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after class one day.,5
“Wait a moment...” said Harry slowly.,5
"Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry.",5
"Not today, though, not now ...” And taking a deep breath, she cried, “Cruc — ” “NO!” shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode.",5
"“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.” “ ’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos.",5
When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L.,5
I thought the first thing you’d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.” The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of dementors.,5
"“Yes,” Dudley whispered, still trembling.",5
Harry expected to go through it .,5
"“You — wait,” he panted, staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing.",5
"Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone, crossed.",5
"“ ‘Same time, same place’?",5
"“It’s what he wants...” “I mean,” said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his gray eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron’s direction, “if it’s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don’t think they’ve got much chance... From what my father says, they’ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years... And as for Potter ... My father says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo’s... apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic...” Malfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling.",5
"Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid’s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many twigs.",5
"“Yeah,” said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him.",5
“What d’you reckon?” “Open it!” said Hermione eagerly.,5
We’ll be study in’ weapons this term...” And Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him...,5
Harry looked sideways at Hermione.,5
"“Er — you don’t know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.",5
"He was sitting under the Sorting Hat, and it was telling him he would do well in Slytherin... Hermione was lying in the hospital wing, her face covered with thick black hair.",5
"“I’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time.” “You should write a book,” Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, “translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them.” “Yeah,” said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table.",5
He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself.,5
"“That’s not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your mother — here — ” He thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and read aloud, “ Dad is still alive.",5
"“All right, Snivellus?” said James loudly.",5
"“Then we should come too,” said Neville simply.",5
"Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention.",5
"Come on, let’s get down to breakfast and see what the others think.",5
"“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T.",5
"“Yeah, IVe got no problem saying Vol — ” “Shut your mouth!” Bellatrix shrieked.",5
He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.” “But he might have chosen wrong!” said Harry.,5
"“Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.” Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days.",5
"Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry’s robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow.",5
“Please?” Harry could not think of anything to say.,5
"“It’s not very neat,” said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside.",5
"“But how are you going to get there?” Again, Harry ignored her.",5
"“Elementary wand safety, nobody bothers about it anymore...” He stumped off toward the kitchen.",5
"He crossed it, placed his hand upon an identical door, and it swung inward... Now he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd, mechanical clicking.",5
"No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning...” “He is planning something to do with me, then?” said Harry swiftly.",5
"Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment.",5
He clutched his head in his hands; the pain was blinding him...,5
“We’ve been wanting to ask you for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what’s inside it?,5
"“Okay,” she said, looking frightened yet determined, “I’ve just got to say this...” “What?” “You ...",5
"Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.",5
"“And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what?” Ron said, stopping mid- sentence at the look on Harry’s face.",5
I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had realized he could use you.,5
"“Wait a moment — there is something you can do for me, Dobby,” said Harry slowly.",5
"He was forced to do Sirius’s bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him.",5
“What’s he keeping in there?,5
"“Watch me,” snarled Mrs. Weasley.",5
"“Shame on you, Phineas!” “Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?” called a gimlet- eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.",5
“Guess what I got for my birthday?” said Neville.,5
"He had become very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit.",5
"“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry.",5
"“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived.",5
"I don’t want to blow it, it’ll need proper planning...",5
Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce.,5
"Snape was beginning to inch toward his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he crawled.",5
I expect you know why you are here?” Harry fully intended to respond with a defiant “yes”: His mouth had opened and the word was half formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore’s face.,5
"Her grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers.",5
"Meanwhile, the goblin and the house- elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool.",5
"and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he had his wand .",5
"I refuse to accept it!” “You didn’t realize this was coming?” said a high girlish voice, sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to his right, saw that Trelawney’s terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor Umbridge.",5
"“But if we don’t leave soon we’re definitely going to miss the train...”  “WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!” Mrs. Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room.",5
Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses.,5
“This is really important... Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?” “Well ...,5
"“I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,” said Hermione’s voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech.",5
"“Well, I’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard ’s opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.” “But — ” Hermione began.",5
Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies?” “But Master — he is here — he is below — ” Voldemort paid no attention.,5
"“No — no, I’ll g-go, Dumbledore!",5
"“Very well,” said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking.",5
"Toast?” “Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry.",5
"“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out there?” “There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.” “Oh yeah?” said Harry.",5
Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T?,5
“So he could know what we’re thinking right now?,5
"Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the doormat.",5
"“Harry,” she said timidly, “don’t you see?",5
"Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing Snape across the table.",5
"“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair.",5
"“Excellent,” said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them onto his plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.",5
"“Ministry of Magic, visitors’ entrance, London, then,” he said uncertainly.",5
Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up.,5
His brain seemed to have jammed.,5
"The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays.",5
"It was a fine, clear day.",5
"For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.",5
"“Why not?” “He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that was not the true reason.",5
"“I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it’s definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him.” Hermione let out a long, slow sigh.",5
"“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it, Hermione.” “We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said Fred, pretending to tremble, “with these two on our case...” “Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said George, shaking his head.",5
None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her.,5
"“She doesn’t think you treated her very well, because you wouldn’t dance with her.",5
"A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.",5
"They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it,” said Ron), to watch over first and second years spending their break times inside because of the bitter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely weren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said Ron), and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got dung for brains, that one,” said Ron furiously).",5
"“You think you’re funny,” she said coldly.",5
Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter.,5
"It was like I was the snake... What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ?”  “One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, “you’ll read Hogwarts, A History, and perhaps that will remind you that you can’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts.",5
"A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head.",5
After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it.,5
"Maybe they make you feel special — important?” “No, they don’t,” said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand.",5
“You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius!” said Hermione accusingly.,5
Nobody seemed much disposed to follow.,5
"“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily.",5
“It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!” Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and  George doing exactly what they liked was not one that he found inviting.,5
“We take it in turns.,5
"“And I don’t know how you stand it, it’s horrible,” she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort.",5
"“Luna — Neville — help me!” The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door.",5
"“Yes, it’s well hidden.” Harry’s misgivings increased.",5
Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face.,5
And Mr. Filch is observing all  secret passages in and out of the castle.,5
"And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought.",5
I defy anyone who has watched you as I have — and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined — not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered.,5
"“Into the forest?” said Hermione, perplexed.",5
There was nobody left to tell.,5
Did he really believe he was better than Ron?,5
“I suppose something in that snake’s venom dissolves them or something...,5
She aimed a curse over her shoulder.,5
"Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, “Me mam didn’t want me to come back.” “What?” said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.",5
"Spell Damage, fourth floor ...” They found Mr. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray in his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face.",5
Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly.,5
"Fine.” “I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione quickly.",5
"“There’s no need to take that tone with me,” she said coolly.",5
"too though, I bet?” said Michael Corner.",5
"Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.” “I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told her cuttingly.",5
"Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly.",5
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George, and Ginny descended upon them.",5
"Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing their arms, closing in front of  Malfoy, ready for the fight.",5
"He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.” “How can he think that?” said Harry angrily.",5
"It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.",5
Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.,5
"Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt,  tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders.",5
He saw Dudley look sideways at it.,5
"heard the high, cold voice say, “ Cruciol ” The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing.",5
The adults seemed to have been midway through a whispered conversation when the door opened; all of them looked around hastily and fell silent.,5
"“Okay,” he said, calling them all to order.",5
"Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear... “I’m — I’m sorry everyone,” said Hermione.",5
He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.,5
In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of its owner.,5
"Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn’t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment dotted with blood.",5
"“He will have ... gone on.” “What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” said Harry quickly.",5
"“Now, you wanted to take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape — so there we are...”  A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless.",5
And he packed his bags the same night and left.,5
“Mmm?” “Did you ... was there any sign of ... did you hear anything about your .,5
"Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.",5
"Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.",5
"They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet.",5
Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that  he had mislabelled Venus as Mars.,5
"“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again.",5
"The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered — The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar.",5
Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: It was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes.,5
"“You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams,” Hermione said now, “because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again...”  Harry threw Ron a furious look.",5
“You can’t come down here!” Ginny was calling to the crowd.,5
"Accio Butterbeeri” He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying toward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of  Sirius’s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them.",5
“Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.” Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out schedules.,5
"On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie’s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.",5
"I think you’d better give her something else instead... How about your Firebolt?” And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, he’d only come to the D.A.",5
"The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forward a little, away from the wall.",5
“But there was a meeting tonight!” said Umbridge furiously.,5
"Dementors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing  him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic — and still no one was telling him what was going on.",5
"With a massive effort Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair, and sat down.",5
"Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava.",5
"Oh — oh, right,” said Ron, very flustered.",5
"“ ’Cause the other centaurs are good an’ riled at me, tha’s why,” said Hagrid quietly, glancing around.",5
"“Yeah “So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?” Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig.",5
His attempt is not working.,5
How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas?,5
He was inside the circular room lined with doors...,5
"“Thank you, Argus,” she said sweetly.",5
"“Mistletoe,” said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.",5
He was in trouble now and he knew it.,5
"“Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?” Harry moved off into the middle of the room.",5
"Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.",5
Harry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving.,5
"“Whadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?” growled Hagrid.",5
"“The owls ... aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly.",5
"“I’m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,” Harry explained.",5
"“And it looks like it’s going to rain.” “What’s that got to do with our homework?” said Hermione, her eyebrows raised.",5
“P- Petunia?” She raised her head.,5
The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face.,5
"Now, in the early morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows.",5
"“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he asked.",5
"“They were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the Wizarding community,” Mrs. Longbottom went on.",5
"Just think of it, Muggles in St. Mungo’s!",5
"As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.",5
Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.,5
"If I jus’ knew someone was carryin’ on tryin’ ter help him a bit ... teachin’ him, yeh know ...” Harry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them.",5
"Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted toward her, and aimed another spell at him.",5
“On’y anythin’ ter do with magical creatures an’ she thinks it’s got somethin’ ter do with me.,5
He could hear a lift clattering ahead of him.,5
further ...” Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.,5
"Harry saw Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the ground.",5
"“ You don’t know what it’s likel You — neither of you — you’ve never had to face him, have you?",5
"“Hark who’s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!” said Ron indignantly.",5
"“It’s all right, Draco,” said Snape, lowering his wand.",5
"“That was about the dullest speech I’ve ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.” “I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione.",5
"They received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron’s spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he collapsed onto the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal.",5
"He and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together, discussing Angelina’s idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that night’s Quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people.",5
She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck.,5
"“You can’t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?” “We’re not going to make them ill, we’ve already tested them all on ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same — ” “If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to — ” “Put us in detention?” said Fred in an I’d-like-to-see- you-try-it voice.",5
“I’ll ... I’ll try and say something to him...,5
"“Stop doing that!” Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.",5
The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar.,5
"That’s why he was in St. Mungo’s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn’t talk.",5
"He had not only seen it before, he had been here before: This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.",5
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages  rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.",5
He had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper.,5
“Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts.,5
“But it wasn’t an ordinary dream ... it was real...,5
"“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far,” she said, standing up and looking positively furious.",5
"They’re two  blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don’t know much about them — ” “We do,” said Harry and Ron together.",5
"He’ll know who’s in the Order and where Sirius is ... and I’ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn’t have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here...",5
"Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who was not wearing radishes in their ears.",5
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight.,5
"Tuck in!” There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables, bread, sauces, and flagons of pumpkin juice.",5
"His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.",5
"The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen.",5
“I’ve just realized ...”  “Realized what?” asked Snape sharply.,5
"“But if they think I’m not going to fight You-Know- Who after what happened to Cedric — ” She broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boot’s wand went whizzing past Harry’s ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose.",5
"Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently too.",5
"“He’s lost his mind,” said Ron in an almost awed voice.",5
"“I know I am,” said Harry.",5
"“Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn’t it?” he said and she gave a very shaky laugh.",5
And Harry’s heart began to race.,5
"“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts ... but you cannot deny he’s got style...”  SNAPE’S WORST MEMORY — BY ORDER OF — THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Dolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.",5
"“Well, they’re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,” said Hagrid.",5
“One of them had fallen.,5
"So he can come back, right?” Nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry.",5
"A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated horribly, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.",5
"“Now ... It’s urgent...” “She’s not here, Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey sadly.",5
"“And I forbid you to hurt yourself!” he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him.",5
"Harry protested... Cho shouted, “ Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog cards, look\” And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air, and then turned into Hermione, who said, “You did promise her, you know, Harry...",5
"Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe’s arms, and Hermione was attempting vainly to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her.",5
"Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard,  who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore ’s voice when he attempted to rouse him.",5
How much more of this was he going to have to take?,5
"“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,” Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra ’s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter’s moons.",5
"“Knows all the crooks — well, he would, seeing as he’s one himself.",5
"Hedwig’s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle  clothes and wizard’s robes that had spilled onto the floor around it.",5
"Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.",5
"“Remember — close your mind — ” But as Dumbledore ’s fingers closed over Harry’s skin, a pain shot through the scar on his forehead, and he felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him — “ — you will understand,” whispered Dumbledore.",5
"What are we doing to stop him?” “We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings,” said Hermione nervously.",5
"“Wizards who have left school,” he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths.",5
Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age?,5
“You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can’t make contact the door’s been Imperturbed.,5
"“I’d forgotten he used to do that,” said Sirius affectionately.",5
"Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day.",5
"Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed, but without any real conviction, and the Weasleys’ looks of disgust were answer enough.",5
"“Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,” said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen.",5
“Let ’em see we kept our promises.,5
"“Hogwarts needs you!” “Enough of this rubbish!” said Fudge, pulling out his own wand.",5
"“And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?”  “Yes,” said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips.",5
"Oh, don’t tell me ...” He gave another shuddering yawn.",5
"He raised his wand, the curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless.",5
"The sun was falling toward the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass, Umbridge jogging to  keep up.",5
"Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven’t you?",5
"“It is a most amazing room, sir.” “How many people know about it?” said Harry, sitting up straighter in his chair.",5
"The happiness was draining out of him, but the laughter continued...",5
"“I’m very well indeed, thank you!” said Lockhart exuberantly, pulling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket.",5
Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in.,5
The man was yelling in pain ... then he fell silent...,5
“It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sibyll was referring.” “Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.,5
"Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking dreamy as always.",5
"“Had a good summer so far?” “No, it’s been lousy,” said Harry.",5
sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor .,5
"“That’s it,” he said in his quavery old voice, “no need to be nervous... Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me...” On the whole Harry thought it went rather well; his Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy’s had been, though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color- Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake.",5
"“I — but — but ... wait\” said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger.",5
"“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked.",5
"Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak.",5
"Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.” Whatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind reading to Harry and he did not like the sound of it at all.",5
"“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones ’s office.",5
"“I’ll be surprised if I don’t get Outstanding on it at least.” “Me too,” said James.",5
"And now the Sorting Hat is here And you all know the score: I sort you into Houses Because that is what I’m for, But this year I’ll go further, Listen closely to my song: Though condemned I am to split you Still I worry that it’s wrong, Though I must fulfill my duty And must quarter every year Still I wonder whether sorting May not bring the end I fear.",5
"He could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him,  when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater.",5
"We’re having a little bit of a celebration, actually...” She gestured at the scarlet banner.",5
Parvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him.,5
"He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs...",5
Harry changed direction mid- word.,5
"“You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn’t you?” “Yes, Harry,” said Hermione gently, “but all the same, there’s no point pretending that you’re not good at  Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are.",5
"He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure  what had just happened.",5
"The few unbruised bits of Hagrid ’s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy’s answer.",5
cousin of my mother’s .,5
"“Professor,” said Parvati, “do you mean ... is it something Professor Umbridge ... ?” “Do not speak to me about that woman!” cried Professor Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing.",5
"last year, for instance ... in the lake ... during the Tournament ... you shouldn’t have ...",5
"As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies.",5
"Harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dumbledore ’s desk.",5
"The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps.",5
"“Keeping an eye on you, of course.” “I’m still being followed?” asked Harry angrily.",5
"It was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfather’s face and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief, one-armed hug.",5
"I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d rather nobody needed it.” She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains, and beckoned them all forward.",5
"Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry; his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder, but as Harry stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.",5
"“No, let’s see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents...",5
“You are not welcome among us!” These words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp.,5
“I need to Disillusion you.” “You need to what?” said Harry nervously.,5
But you see what they’re doing?,5
"He looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight hats.",5
"I can still get him from here,” he said, raising his wand and taking aim between Smith’s shoulder blades.",5
He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates.,5
"“Because he doesn’t want to draw attention to himself at the moment,” said Sirius.",5
“What does that mean?” Hermione read aloud: “In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented  level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.,5
"As I was saying — you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal.",5
"“Look, I wouldn’ be tellin’ yer  this at all if I didn’ have ter.",5
"""... and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night duty tomorrow, I’m just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.",5
"“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry.",5
"“Told her Percy’s nothing more than a humongous pile of rat droppings “ — didn’t work,” said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog.",5
"They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like “Weasley Is Our King.” They crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent, snowy grounds.",5
"“I’m not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time — did you put in the countercharm for hiccups?",5
"“You’re always having a go at each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning his shepherd’s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there.",5
"“You just had to be nice to her,” said Hermione, looking up anxiously.",5
"“Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go!” said Harry angrily.",5
"“However, that is no reason not to do your very best.",5
It was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on the plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated broomsticks.,5
"When he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it open  he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him.",5
By the evening Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.,5
"“Harry, I’b sorry!” cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, “I’b so sorry, Harry, I didn’d bean do — ■” “It doesn’t matter!” Harry shouted.",5
"“Hey, Harry,” Hermione called from the other end of the room, “have you checked the time?” He looked down at his watch and received a shock — it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out-of-bounds.",5
"Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day that he had come  with Mr. Weasley — he was sure that the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the lift halted, the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” and the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift.",5
"Ron seemed to notice Harry’s tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward.",5
"“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge.",5
She continued to scribble for a few moments.,5
It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door.,5
"“Where do we go, then, Harry?” Ron asked.",5
"“Hope this clears up ... What’s up with you, Hermione?”  She too was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw it.",5
"Our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us...” “Professor Trelawney did Astrology with us!” said Parvati excitedly, raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back.",5
"All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.",5
"“It’s headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it?",5
"Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him... “NOOOOOOO!” He was on his knees again, his face buried in his hands, his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull.",5
"He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.",5
“Yeah ... I’ve said it before...,5
"When we heard — and that Ministry hearing — it’s just outrageous, I’ve looked it all up, they can’t expel you, they just can’t, there’s provision in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life- threatening situations — ” “Let him breathe, Hermione,” said Ron, grinning, closing the door behind Harry.",5
"Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.",5
His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.,5
"“It makes such a nice change.” COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVENT GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE — ”  “The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said George, shaking his head.",5
"Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother’s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.",5
He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover.,5
"“Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,” said Ginny, shrugging.",5
He was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not.,5
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever.,5
"Now, if you let me write the story from that angle — ” “We don’t need another story about how Harry’s lost his marbles!” said Hermione angrily.",5
When he heard Mrs. Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated farther upstairs and ignored her.,5
Even Fawkes had fallen silent.,5
"“We’ll — er — we’ll go back now, shall we?” Harry and Hermione nodded.",5
"How could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn’t need one, yet now ...",5
"“Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I’m back... Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!” “I dunno if you got through to him,” said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went.",5
"Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge.",5
"When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell Dumbledore this?” “Yes,” said Harry impatiently, “but he didn’t tell me what it meant.",5
I should’ve done it years ago!,5
I can no longer return to the forest.,5
Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny ’s head; he glanced at the topmost one.,5
"He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper.",5
I can’t wait to show it to Professor Sprout.,5
"“Well ... think about it,” said Hermione quietly.",5
"“It ... well, I don’t know whether ... but it’s worth trying ... and I’m the only one who can “I hate it when she does that,” grumbled Ron as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great Hall.",5
He kept looking around nervously as they descended toward the lawn below.,5
"“What’s going on?” he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up.",5
Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment.,5
"“Blimey!” said Ron, also staring at the man.",5
Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time.,5
"“I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron — ” “Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!” said Ron hotly.",5
"“Well, they were the ones bein’ beaten to a pulp, weren’ they?” said Hagrid patiently.",5
Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend.,5
The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest.,5
"If he had known, this time last night,  that in twenty-four hours’ time he would have kissed Cho Chang ... “ ’Night,” grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right.",5
"But he wouldn’t do that now, it would be too — Siriusl” She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill.",5
He also wondered why so many of them were there.,5
“Harry ... I’b really sorry...” said Neville.,5
"If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then?",5
"“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge’s note again.",5
Harry and the dog followed her.,5
"He had just turned it upside down to see whether it looked better that  way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed.",5
"“While he may feel secure enough to use the name ... the rest of us ...” He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin.",5
"“I’m sorry, lads, but I’m not taking a Knut under twenty.” “Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry.",5
"Smiling to himself, he closed his eyes...",5
"A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.",5
He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him; a  confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart.,5
"All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead, no, it couldn’t be But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs — “Mrs.",5
"” “There you are, Harry,” said Ron, looking awestruck.",5
"Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley.",5
"“Oh hi,” said Harry, pulling his books back toward him.",5
"Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched, Hermione was rereading Achievement in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred, and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.",5
"Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.",5
Many of the students exchanged looks of glee.,5
"“Won’t — won’t you?” he added uncertainly, meeting Harry’s eyes.",5
I must not tell lies.,5
"“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud?",5
"From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look.",5
"“Is it very far in?” Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble.",5
"“What the — ?” The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled, green light.",5
"Diddy, darling, speak to Mummy!",5
"This isn’t a criticism, Harry!",5
The only new bit was — ” Crack.,5
"“I told Sirius last time.” “Well, tell him about this time!” “Can’t, can I?” said Harry grimly.",5
"At Sirius’s words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him.",5
"He was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not alone; she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex- journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione’s least favorite people in the world.",5
“ — He stands there — filthy half-blood “WAIT UNTIL WEVE GOT THE PROPHECY!” bawled Malfoy.,5
"“ Time ...” The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to babyhood once more...",5
"Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now\” “I — oh all right,” she said desperately.",5
"“I-I think so,” she said shakily.",5
"“She didn’t look very well...” “Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,” said Alicia Spinnet firmly.",5
"“Well ...” said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye.",5
"In the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl.",5
"“But of course,” she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, “Little Miss Perfect wouldn’t want that story out there, would she?” “As a matter of fact,” said Hermione sweetly, “that’s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.”  Rita stared at her.",5
"So Potter says he saw it all happen?” “Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley.",5
"A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry’s chest, almost immediately strangled by panic — how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic?",5
"“You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?” Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting.",5
"“She must know you’re out of your beds... Minerva, go and head her off — tell her any story — ” Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.",5
"“Oh yeah — ‘sever ties’ with me, I swear I won’t get violent.” “Give it back,” said Ron, holding out his hand.",5
If some far-fetched story appears they say something like ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter’ and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it’s let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his forehead or we’ll be asked to worship him next — ’ ” “I don’t want anyone to worship — ” Harry began hotly.,5
"She knows, Harry thought desperately.",5
“I’m not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she’s got to me.” “Got to you?,5
Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.,5
"“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to his feet.",5
It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest.,5
I saw him.” Her hands found Dudley’s massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them.,5
"He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.",5
"“Professor, is there anything — er — wrong?” “Wrong!” cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion.",5
“Oh yeah?” “He cheeked me.” “Yeah?,5
Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 53 .,5
The story of Fred and George’s flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend.,5
"“What’s ready?” demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed Hermione ’s shoulders again and shook her slightly.",5
"“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate.",5
"He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left... Black’s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy.” “How do you know all this?” Harry said.",5
"With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.",5
She leapt to her feet the moment he entered.,5
"If the plant was sent anonymously, how’s anyone ever going to find out who did it?” Harry was not thinking about Devil’s Snare.",5
And I can’t imagine why she would say they were there if they weren’t — ” “But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?” snorted Fudge.,5
"“Ahem — twenty minutes to go,” said Professor Tofty.",5
"Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a  battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows.",5
“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George indignantly.,5
"Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold.",5
"“Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good — fifty points to Slytherin!",5
"“You two,” she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, “are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.” “You know what?” said Fred.",5
"Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur?",5
"The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children’s books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.",5
“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.,5
"“ Well?” he demanded, looking from one to the other.",5
“And our tolerance is waning!” Hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian again.,5
"Bill took out his wand, muttered “Evanescol” and the scrolls vanished.",5
“Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it’s gone!,5
"You have, haven’t you?” Again, Marietta shook her head.",5
"Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror.",5
"She strode around behind her desk and faced them, quivering with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside onto the floor.",5
"This ... this is exactly why we need you... We need to know what it’s r-really like ... facing him ... facing V-Voldemort.” It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort’s name, and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry.",5
"Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it — I don’t think Filch would object, when’s he ever stuck up for a student’s rights?",5
"“Let me out,” Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore ’s.",5
He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they stand for?,5
She was even nearer him now.,5
He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag; it was becoming steadily dirtier.,5
"You’ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley.",5
"“And Ron?” “I dink he’s all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left — ” The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville’s hand had been seconds before.",5
"“I’ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?” “Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a hurry.” They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot.",5
He sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying toward him.,5
"“Erm ... Quidditch later,” said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs toward him.",5
"“So ... so do you think I’m being possessed, then?” “Well, can you remember everything you’ve been doing?” Ginny asked.",5
Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by.,5
"“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore politely.",5
"I repeat, this is a lie.",5
He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile.,5
"“Never mind spots, the idiots can’t come over here now, it’ll look really suspicious — sit down!” she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table.",5
Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pajamas.,5
Did he say?” asked Harry.,5
"The back, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins.",5
"“Tarantallegrcd” he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again.",5
He had more important work to do...,5
He ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead.,5
"Good night.” “Hang on, don’t go yet!",5
"“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin.",5
The oak front doors had swung open.,5
"You understand?” “Yes,” said Harry.",5
Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer; George was hiccuping.,5
Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the school; he looked utterly woebegone.,5
"“You’ve got him,” said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row.",5
"“It’s ... locked ...” said Harry, throwing his weight at the door, but it did not budge.",5
"“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt right in front of him.",5
"”  The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and alarm from the Wizarding community, which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was “no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us once more.” Details of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy, though it is believed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select band of followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.",5
"“Quite a few people — ” “ — we’ve met about twenty of them,” said Ron, “but we think there are more...” Harry glared at them.",5
"Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape toward the second floor.",5
"“Harry,” said a hoarse voice in Harry’s ear.",5
"“Well,” said Harry, slightly nervously.",5
"Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden.",5
“Never try to understand the students.,5
"Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight.",5
“How’re we supposed to get on?” said Ron faintly.,5
Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak?,5
James and Sirius eyed it warily.,5
"“What makes you think that?” “Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,” she said coolly, “and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the first place...” Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp’s blood.",5
When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him.,5
Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my second cousin once removed.,5
"Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy’s jaw; looking down he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release.",5
Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.,5
"I’ve definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly.",5
“Um ... shall we just have a look in the shops or something?” They wandered toward Dervish and Banges.,5
"Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like “Dung” and “Umbridge” at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice.",5
"“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron bracingly.",5
“Dumbledore!” “What news?” said Dumbledore at once.,5
"His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door toward Buckbeak’s room, singing “God Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice.",5
"The  Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him.",5
"They think hell be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer ...Of course, that might mean we’re here for Christmas...” “The more the merrier!” said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help with breakfast.",5
"Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?” This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it was almost as though he knew ... “I was the snake,” he said.",5
Who wants to be famous for that?,5
"“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said Hermione simply.",5
"“A few ...” “More or less than eight?” “Less, I s’pose,” said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.",5
“No ... well ... all right ...,5
"“So you haven’t had any news about Hagrid, either?” “Ah ...” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back by now, no one’s sure what’s happened to him.” Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, “But Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three get yourselves in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine.” “But if he was supposed to be back by now ...” said Hermione in a small, worried voice.",5
"“I mistranslated ‘ehwaz,’ ” said Hermione furiously.",5
"“Oh ... right.” “You know what?” said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous look.",5
Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.,5
"“ — now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,” George said hastily.",5
"Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses flat against the windows.",5
"“You’ve given me an evening off every week!” “That’s for Quidditch practice,” said Hermione.",5
"Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform .",5
"Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own name.",5
"Only Ron’s brother Percy reckons there will be — ” “I don’t know,” said Sirius, “I haven’t seen anyone from the Order all weekend, they’re all busy.",5
“Spray that at once and throw it away!” Harry looked around.,5
"He can’t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd.",5
"“Sorry!” Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether he had done any damage.",5
"“The Aurors are on their way — ” “By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort.",5
"“We’re workin’ in here today!” Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him.",5
"When Harry had finished she said slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know- Who’s controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?” “Well,” said Harry, dropping his voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?” “I suppose so,” said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced.",5
The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.,5
"“Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?” Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’s forehead.",5
"“Oh ... hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice.",5
"“Wands away,” she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags.",5
"Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.",5
HARRY!” Someone had hit him around the face.,5
"The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry’s spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim.",5
"Miss Granger?” “Bowtruckles,” said Hermione.",5
"Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing.",5
"“He’s not there.”  Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup.",5
"Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.",5
"The song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly toward the castle, which was bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders... Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He didn’t let the Quaffle in, Weasley is our King .",5
"Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the forest.",5
"After breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village.",5
"Professor Flitwick went scurrying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked, “Locomotor trunksl” and Professor Trelawney’s luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her, Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear.",5
“What is this?” Uncle Vernon said hoarsely.,5
"Go and wash them before dinner, please...” Ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again.",5
"I was nine.” “I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.",5
"“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,” drawled Mr. Malfoy.",5
"“Well, let’s try again,” said Angelina.",5
"“ T3out twenty feet,” said Hagrid casually.",5
"Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened up, and stared around.",5
“What did he say prefers the dark — did you hear?”  Harry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered the forest before now; he had not been very brave then either.,5
"“Loved it,” said Lupin briskly.",5
"“ — so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the team — come on, Ron!” But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between them, straight through Ron’s central hoop.",5
He’s got the right to know what’s been happen — ” “Hang on!” interrupted George loudly.,5
She was making notes on her clipboard now.,5
Harry could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield — He wrenched himself free of her and turned.,5
“I — didn’t — ” Snape threw Harry from him with all his might.,5
"“Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,” she said briskly to Snape ’s back.",5
"A hundred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake... Cho Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe... No, said a voice in Harry’s head, as the memory of Cho drew nearer, you’re not watching that, you’re not watching it, it’s private — He felt a sharp pain in his knee.",5
"“Why — what’s all this about?” “I shall explain everything,” repeated Dumbledore, “when Harry is back at school.” He walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard’s head lay on the floor.",5
“So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?” asked Hermione.,5
"He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and almost collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale and apprehensive.",5
"“Think I did,” said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds.",5
"Seamus handed back Harry’s essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A.",5
Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn’t have it underground like the Ministry — unhealthy.,5
He did not know that you would have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ — ” “But I don’t!” said Harry in a strangled voice.,5
"C’mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology.” Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast.",5
"He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they healed over seconds later.",5
Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and they were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done.,5
I only qualified a year ago.,5
"“After all, the Easter holidays start on Friday, we’ll have plenty of time then...” “Are you feeling all right?” Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief.",5
"“The prefects as well?” said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione.",5
"“Get down here, I’ve got a letter for you.” With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down onto his shoulder.",5
"“Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran’s, and she’s never mentioned the Malfoys.” “What’s she like, Neville?” asked Hermione at once.",5
"As he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, looked blearily into the fire and said, “Sirius!” Harry whipped around; Sirius’s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.",5
"“ ’S too late, isn’t it?",5
"“Yes,” said Harry, “but — ” “Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen?” “Yes, but — ” “Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?” “Yes, but — ” “Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time?",5
"When he entered it right behind Ron, and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing, he was therefore momentarily stunned.",5
You are not aware that you have broken any school rules?” “School rules?” said Harry.,5
Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike...,5
"Yes, I thought we might hit that little snag.” “Snag?” said Fudge, his voice still vibrating with joy.",5
At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.,5
Over ... over a friends broomstick.,5
"“There’s no point telling him again.” Ron did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry thoughtfully.",5
"“You know, her mum works for the Ministry, it’s really difficult for her — ” “Ron’s dad works for the Ministry too!” Harry said furiously.",5
"From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter.",5
"An’ Ron, if he’s willin’.” “Of course well help you,” said Harry at once.",5
"“Tha’s how you ended up pullin’ up the others — ” And sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree’s roots beginning to crack.",5
"“He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me — ” “Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.",5
"Luna, I mean.” Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh.",5
It seemed to have worked.,5
"“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, and left it at that.",5
He had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries.,5
"“Come on, now, that won’t activate the jinx further...” Everyone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta’s face.",5
"He has done nothing, nothing to warrant such — ” Hermione, Parvati, and Lavender all screamed.",5
"“I would warn Hagrid myself, but I am banished — it would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now — Hagrid has troubles enough, without a centaurs’ battle.” “But — what’s Hagrid attempting to do?” said Harry nervously.",5
"One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr. Weasley, but most averted their eyes.",5
"“She’s my auntie,” she said.",5
"“D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived here?” “You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.” “I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron.",5
You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore!,5
"“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror,” said Ron in an offhand voice.",5
"“What do you mean, ‘tried’?” said Ron quickly.",5
"“Oh gosh, I forgot!” said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins.",5
Arthur’s just told us what’s happened.,5
"“You’re related to the Malfoys!” “The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius.",5
"“He’s really, really miserable, actually...” She lowered her voice to a whisper.",5
None of these things actually works you know — ” “Dragon claw does work!” said Ron.,5
So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.” She turned sharply and marched back to the door.,5
Harry looked around at Umbridge.,5
"He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.",5
"Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.",5
"She’s Loony ... Loony Lovegood ... ha ha ha...” “We’ve got to get out of here,” said Harry firmly.",5
"A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers.",5
"“To me,” said Malfoy yet again.",5
"Indeed, a week after Fred and George’s departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews the other way.” To cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet.",5
"“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?” “No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge.",5
"“Now, we need to keep students away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin’s bound to go and tip her off...” “Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said Ginny promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s let off a load of Garroting Gas.” Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie.",5
“Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be.,5
"Outrageous behavior!” “COWARDS!” bellowed Hagrid, his voice carrying clearly to the top of the tower, and several lights  flickered back on inside the castle.",5
"He could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.",5
"Harry got into bed, thinking about the match.",5
"Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so.",5
"The black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors...  Straight across the stone floor and through the second door .",5
"“Whoever’s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!” he said.",5
“Golgomath’s lot raided the caves.,5
"“So?” “So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you?",5
"This was where he, Harry, had seen him...",5
Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him.,5
He reached the black door but could not open it...,5
"“You think people will take him seriously if he’s published in The Quibbler?” “Some people won’t,” said Hermione in a level voice.",5
It was like watchin’ bits o’ the mountain movin’.” “How big are they?” asked Ron in a hushed voice.,5
"Hey — CHO!” He ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase.",5
"“Yeah, go on ...” “It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coach’s dark interior.",5
He had very good reason to be suspicious.,5
"“And I wish they’d stop singing that stupid song,” said Hermione miserably, “haven’t they gloated enough?” A great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch.",5
"Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described.",5
"Good Hufflepuff she took the rest, And taught them all she knew, Thus the Houses and their founders Retained friendships firm and true.",5
"He said gruffly, “Look after yourself, Harry,” and next moment Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying him down the steps.",5
"There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully.",5
"He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief.",5
"I’m going to bed.” She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and stood back to admire the effect.",5
"I’m quite sure I slipped in a note ...” “What, this thing?” said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry’s folder.",5
"“Because,” said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, “I don’t think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.” Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him.",5
He desisted only when his  partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.,5
"“Sit down, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall tersely.",5
"“STUBEFY, STUBEFYl” But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches.",5
"“Dobby knows the perfect place, sir!” he said happily.",5
"“Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about.",5
Snape’s dark eyes bored into Harry’s.,5
Professor Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.,5
"But twenty-nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague’s watch strap...",5
“What is it?” Harry asked.,5
“I — er — ” he said.,5
"“My greatest strength, is it?” said Harry, his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it.",5
"“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down beside Harry.",5
"“I saw it all from the snake’s point of view...” Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking at Ron, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is Arthur seriously injured?” “ Yes” said Harry emphatically — why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side?",5
"“Well,” said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, “we’ve replaced you.” “Replaced me?” said Harry blankly.",5
"One by one, as though hit over the heads with invisible mallets, the first years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right onto the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling out.",5
"“Hagrid’s little brother,” said Ron promptly.",5
"Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once: Defense Against the Dark Arts A Return to Basic Principles.",5
"“Sorry,” said Neville again, in a small voice.",5
"We should try a few doors,” he said hastily.",5
"“Dementors don’t run, they glide.” “That’s what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks.",5
“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle Vernon.,5
"Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling.",5
“Oh ... yeah ...” said Ron.,5
"Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too.",5
"Harry shrugged; he was quite as mystified by that as she was, though, oddly, it was not bothering him very much at the moment.",5
"“Yeah ... well ... good,” he said.",5
Have they sentenced you to anything?,5
"Good afternoon, class!” “Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted back at her.",5
"“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up.",5
"make it easier for You-Know — ” “Shut up, Ron,” said Hermione angrily.",5
"He pulled out his wand, tapped his glasses and said, “Imperviusl” “I think we all ought to try that,” said Angelina.",5
"Then, as the pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.",5
He was only vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity.,5
"“My son and his wife,” she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, “were tortured into insanity by You-Know- Who’s followers.” Hermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths.",5
"“And I’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,” said Tonks enviously.",5
"He was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing.",5
"“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” said Ron sarcastically.",5
"“Hey,” said a voice in Harry’s ear.",5
Sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait because she had stopped screaming.,5
"He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry’s face.",5
"What about ‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?” Dudley said nothing.",5
"“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!” “No,” said Harry flatly.",5
The lump in his throat was painful.,5
"“I thought you said she was giving you lines?” Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge’s office.",5
Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge’s note and looked very seriously at Harry.,5
"“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above.",5
It’ll happen anyway — ” “No — ” Aunt Petunia’s hand was trembling.,5
He had just heard something.,5
"A hand grabbed the scruff of Harry’s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off — several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes  screeched, and a cloud of dust filled the air.",5
"“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts.",5
"The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you’re carrying them in a pocket you’ll be able to feel them.",5
"“You can see the thestrals, Longbottom, can you?” she said.",5
"“She obviously reckons Trelawney’s an old fraud too... Looks like she’s put her on probation.” Umbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness.",5
"As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again.",5
"Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended.",5
"But no, that wouldn’t do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville next time?",5
"He also suspected that part of his mind — the part that often spoke in Hermione’s voice — now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach journey’s end.",5
"He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!",5
"Yeh’d think, seein’ as how their whole race is abou’ finished, they’d lay off each other, but ...” Hagrid sighed deeply “That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin’ down on the valley.",5
He had just remembered that she too could see thestrals.,5
"“How did it go?” Hermione whispered, and then, looking concerned, “Are you all right, Harry?” “Yeah ... fine ...",5
"Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first; he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of “Weasley Is Our King,” but agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good.",5
"“They’re really useful.” “Extendable — ?” “Ears, yeah.",5
Just stay in the house.,5
"Candles floated in midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one another, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and robes.",5
"I can see them too.” “Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna.",5
"Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it.",5
"“Come on, hurry,” growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.",5
"“What?” he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth.",5
"When Professor Marchbanks said, “Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,” Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but that he had, with luck, avoided a fail.",5
"“He did recognize Sirius on the platform...” “What?” said Ron, looking alarmed.",5
"Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.” “I can’t see old Flitwick getting marked down,” said George, “he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.” “Who’ve you got this afternoon?” Fred asked Harry.",5
"“What are heliopaths?” asked Neville, looking blank.",5
"At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble  stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.” “Testers?” “Us,” said Fred.",5
"“But I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter!” “But why?” asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted to cry.",5
"Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.",5
"“Well, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,” he heard Sirius say.",5
"“Undoubtedly I shall in the end,” said the cold voice.",5
therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts .,5
"And let’s face it, we don’t know how many of the people who turned up we can trust... Any of them could have run off and told Umbridge...” And he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired him .",5
He did not like people staring at his scar.,5
"He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius.",5
"“Then you get P for ‘Poor’ ” — Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration — “and D for ‘Dreadful.’ ” “And then T,” George reminded him.",5
"Same time, same place next week?” “Sooner!” said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement.",5
Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor.,5
"What’ve you done with Umbridge?” “She got carried away,” said Harry.",5
"“ ‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night.",5
"On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one- handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end.",5
"“What happened then, Potter?” he asked, eyeing Harry intently.",5
"“Excellent,” said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, “so we don’t have to worry about it till the holidays...” Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks’ time, waiting for his O.W.L.",5
"I was on a secret mission, wasn’ I, didn’ wan’ owls followin’ me all over the place — ruddy dementors!",5
"After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said, “What has happened to you?",5
He felt that Hermione should have seen this coming.,5
"“Oh blimey,” said Hagrid quietly.",5
Footsteps were coming up the stairs again.,5
Extra lessons with Snape — what on earth had he done to deserve this?,5
"“Ginny — are you all — ?” “Harry,” said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes.",5
"“Where are we?” Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, “In a minute.” Moody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with cold.",5
"But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn’t going to complain...” “So how come they promoted him?”  “That’s exactly what we wondered,” said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling.",5
"Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting anymore...",5
"I have written to the Minister of Magic and am expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now.",5
"And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!” She strode back toward the staff table.",5
"“It isn’t true, you’re lying — MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED — DO NOT PUNISH ME “Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever.",5
Harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves.,5
"“Ah, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione’s parents, whom he had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in turns to hug Hermione.",5
She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans.,5
"“Why are you down there?” “Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire,” said Harry.",5
Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus.,5
Blood rushed into Professor McGonagall’s face.,5
"The force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it.",5
"But Harry’s already missed History of Magic and I don’t think he ought to miss anything else today!” There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, over- perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody.",5
"Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him.",5
"He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great.",5
"“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder.",5
“When are you going to start using his name?,5
Pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings?,5
"“Potter, you need to be careful.” Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her.",5
The rest of the room was very quiet.,5
"“He wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.” “He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said Hermione wisely.",5
"He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about all summer, he was going home... For a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.",5
"I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack.",5
“I want the truth about what happened tonight!” barked Uncle Vernon.,5
Next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.,5
“Of course I do!” said Sirius.,5
It had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by Knight Bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads.,5
"“You know, I’m sure if you just talked to Cho ...” “It’s not Cho I want to talk to,” said Harry brusquely.",5
"“Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct them,” she said.",5
"“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning.",5
"I really don’t think there’s any point in meeting less than once a week — ”  “Hang on,” said Angelina, “we need to make sure this doesn’t clash with our Quidditch practice.” “No,” said Cho, “nor with ours.” “Nor ours,” added Zacharias Smith.",5
"The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on the wall behind them.",5
"“Harry’s arrived.” “Eh?” said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his matted ginger hair.",5
"“I forgot—” Madam Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face contorted with rage.",5
"Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, staring down at his own dead body on the floor.",5
"“But I’m the last Black left, so it’s mine now.",5
"“Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re born, not made.",5
“Let’s crack on then — who can tell me what these things are called?” She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her.,5
"“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.",5
Or has Dumbledore sent you here?,5
"You two — Crabbe — Goyle — ” She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward.",5
"Snape looked around at him, frowning.",5
Instead he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.,5
Something caught Harry’s attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.,5
There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry’s mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet.,5
“He has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.” Professor Umbridge’s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing.,5
Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the hall; she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick.,5
"“Drawing room ...” he growled, as the pupil contracted.",5
Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord.,5
"“Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.”  There was an outbreak of muttering at this.",5
"“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James.",5
"“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what — ” “The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about.",5
"“Well, you’ve got a funny way of showing it!” said Mrs. Longbottom.",5
"“Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.”  When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it.",5
"but the house-elves have been warned not to tell ...” He ran headfirst at the wall: Harry, who had some experience of Dobby’s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats.",5
"They stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, “Well — er — shall we go, then?” “Oh — yes ...” They joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each other’s eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other.",5
"“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway,” he said, “other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.” Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it.",5
"He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house... “Harry, I owe you an explanation,” said Dumbledore.",5
"Sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward Snape, pulling out his wand as he went; Snape whipped out his own.",5
"Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below.",5
"They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs.",5
"Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed.",5
“I still can’t work out whether they believe he’s back or not.,5
"I used to work in the department after — after all...” “Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it.”  “Bode could never have taken it, Master.",5
"I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father — I was wrong.” “But that’s okay, is it?” yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls.",5
"“I was starting to think you’d go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,” he said.",5
Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual.,5
"Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watch- wizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force his way through a top-security door at one o’clock in the morning.",5
People exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully Then Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her.,5
"Before he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort’s thoughts or moods that he experienced every now and then.",5
"You think it’s just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing  them at him, like you’re in class or something?",5
DO NOT DO ANYMORE MAGIC.,5
Others had crammed themselves onto the marble staircase.,5
"I just wish I knew why...” He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigor.",5
"“Overall,” said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank’s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, “how do you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose you might say — how do you find Hogwarts?",5
"“Well, my father is very supportive of any anti- Ministry action!” said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head.",5
Lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once.,5
"“You kept blocking me.” “And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,” said Cho, smiling reminiscently.",5
"“Hmm,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked.",5
"Signed: Cornelius Oswald Fudge MINISTER OF MAGIC The notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore  had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister of Magic, and his Junior Assistant to escape.",5
"“Banned,” said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the common room.",5
They were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade.,5
“Left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom!,5
We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought.,5
"“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.",5
“If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time ...” snarled Harry.,5
"As you must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good.",5
"“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly.",5
"“That’s him, Mad-Eye,” said Lupin.",5
They both murmured “Lumos\” and their wand tips ignited.,5
"“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, “I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months.",5
"“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly.",5
Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching him.,5
"Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority’s rules.",5
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again.,5
"“I just — oh, Hagrid).” “It’s nuthin’, it’s nuthin’!” said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror.",5
"Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.",5
They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe.,5
"“At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,” said Ron.",5
"I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June.” There was a shocked silence, then Hermione’s teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor.",5
"“Don’t know what you’re complaining about, myself.” “ What?” said Harry incredulously.",5
Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared.,5
There were more figures at the foot of Harry’s bed.,5
"He looked around as they walked toward him and, seeing whom it was, beamed.",5
"“I told them to be here about now and I’m sure they all know where it is — oh look, this might be them now — ” The door of the pub had opened.",5
"“Did I say that?” said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves.",5
He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch.,5
"“No, they got chased off by Grawp,” said Harry.",5
She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious.,5
"“Oh yeah,” said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.",5
No fewer than four Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor McGonagall.,5
"“You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself.",5
His legs were still dancing uncontrollably.,5
"“Why ... oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!” “Now he remembers!” snarled Angelina.",5
Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe.,5
"“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire.",5
"These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.",5
“You have been developing some method of resistance?,5
"An Organization, Society, Team, Group, or Club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students.",5
Little stars erupted in them.,5
"“And what are you going to do?” Harry asked, eyeing Snape ’s wand apprehensively.",5
"Still pointing her shaking wand at Magorian, she continued, “Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions — ’ ” “ ‘Near-human intelligence’?” repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground.",5
"“Well, actually ... no, Ron,” said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically.",5
"Feeling rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.",5
I wonder what they’re doing with them?” Harry joined her at the tank.,5
"Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, toward the far end of the room, muttering under its breath all the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog’s, ""...",5
Harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes.,5
"“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.",5
He did not even check his watch.,5
"“Oh ... tha’s jus’ normal bumps an’ bruises, Harry,” said Hagrid dismissively.",5
You will be taking a Portkey.” He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk.,5
"“Now, Grawpy, don’ do that!” shouted Hagrid.",5
"Weasley, why — ?”  “Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to dash,” Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly.",5
"“Hello, Harry,” said George, beaming at him.",5
"As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek, “WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT’S THE GENERAL IDEA?” “Typical Dad,” said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor.",5
"Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself.",5
"December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth years.",5
"“Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,” she said abruptly.",5
Let go of his anger?,5
Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.,5
"Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double doors into the entrance hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners.",5
"“Borrowed it from Dumbledore,” growled Moody, pocketing the Put-Outer.",5
"Something he didn’t have last time.” I’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel.",5
"“Are you quite sure it’s him, Lupin?” he growled.",5
"“Yes, My Lord, yes ...",5
How old was your opponent?,5
He could feel one of the other’s quickened breath on the back of his head.,5
"“I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t me, it was — ” But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window.",5
"“Well, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such information.",5
"There was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished.",5
"He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far — something that neither your parents, nor Neville’s parents, ever achieved.” “Why did he do it, then?” said Harry, who felt numb and cold.",5
k k k The second detention was just as bad as the previous one.,5
"“There isn’t any Seer blood in your family, is there?” she inquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart of the city.",5
"I should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’ One more time, please.",5
“I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story — ” Dumbledore cleared his throat.,5
"Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass.",5
“D’you know if there’s going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow?,5
“And ask him what’s happening about ... about his little friend!” Harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory.,5
"“We’re your guard, Potter.” “We’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it’s safe to set off,” said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window.",5
Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door.,5
"Harry pulled out parchment  and quill, crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said.",5
Wasn’ a great mother.” They were silent again.,5
"Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, “Be reasonable, Hagrid!” and Hagrid roared, “Reasonable be damned, yeh won’ take me like this, Dawlish!” Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground.",5
"He took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, “Very well, very well ... cleared of all charges.” “Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish.",5
"Did Mrs. Polkiss give you something foreign for tea?” “Why are you all covered in dirt, darling?",5
They returned to the air.,5
"“I mean, all right, we can go and look  jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose — ” “No, I agree, we’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,” said Hermione.",5
"“Sibyll Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,” continued Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them, “but she wastes her time, in the main, on the self- P a g e | 768Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling.",5
They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets set at intervals along the shelves.,5
It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately.,5
"Lifting his head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright.",5
"“But Harry, first of all, you’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears — ” “I can’t tell him that, he’d kill me!” said Harry, outraged.",5
"“Soon?” “Almost at once,” said Lupin, “we’re just waiting for the all-clear.” “Where are we going?",5
Harry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground.,5
"“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O — ” “Hermione,” said Ron sharply, “if you want to know what grades we got, ask.” “I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me “I got a P,” said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl.",5
"“It’s my owl, she’s injured.” “Injured owl, did you say?” Professor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall’s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet “Yes,” said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, “she turned up after the other post owls and her wing’s all funny, look — ” Professor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched.",5
"Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could  ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.",5
Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll- hunting and give the trolls rights .,5
"They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell.",5
Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat.,5
"Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest swelling.",5
"His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch... And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather’s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place.",5
"Mrs. Norris came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily.",5
You surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?” “We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.,5
Get out and never darken our doorstep again!,5
"“If you don’t — if you keep me in here — if you don’t let me — ” “By all means continue destroying my possessions,” said Dumbledore serenely.",5
"Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, confirmed that ten high- security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening, and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals.",5
"“Knowing her won’t hurt your chances though, will it?” Ron told him encouragingly.",5
All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end as soon as possible.,5
"Extendable Ears,” he added in response to Harry’s raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw was trailing out onto the landing.",5
"I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expectations’ for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory; as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores?” “Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,” simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet.",5
Ron\” It was Angelina and she was hurrying toward them looking perfectly desperate.,5
"“You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect?",5
"They were standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.",5
"Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind.",5
Hermione’s explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand.,5
"The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.",5
"He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius said, “Stuff he can only get by stealth.” When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, “Like a weapon.",5
The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.,5
"When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment.",5
"“I’ve got to find the others,” said Harry.",5
‘The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch.,5
"“I don’t hate her,” said Hermione loftily.",5
"“Hasn’t asked how Dad is or visited him or anything...” “We tried to comfort her,” said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry’s portrait.",5
"“Umbridge is shorter than that woman,” she said quietly.",5
"You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle.",5
Harry saw it spill over his chin onto his chest.,5
"Lavender and Parvati were both crying silently, their arms around each other.",5
"He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind.",5
“But it would’ve shown confidence in him.,5
“Er ... yeah ... good stuff abou’ thestrals.,5
"He rolled over onto his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at once...",5
"He pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain.",5
"Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him that he should not listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but he had no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether he would have dared to even if he had the chance.",5
"“Less than zero,” said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops onto his plate and starting to eat.",5
"I think James was everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular, he was good at Quidditch, good at pretty much everything.",5
She and Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests.,5
"“He’s always saying he’d believe anything of Fudge, I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated!",5
"Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done.",5
"Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark.",5
"“More recently,” said Dumbledore, “I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists.",5
"Because of the exams?” “Oh yeah,” said Ron.",5
"“Don’t be scared, dear, don’t be frightened,” said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, “it’s quite all right, now.",5
An owl hooted somewhere out in the night.,5
"“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned.",5
"He’d have to duel with the Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he’d be lucky to escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion.",5
He was really going back.,5
"A greasy-haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shooting down flies... A girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick — “ENOUGH!” Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he took several staggering steps backward, hit some of the shelves covering Snape’s walls and heard something crack.",5
"“Very well,” she said, “you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days’ time.” “I can hardly wait,” said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the door.",5
"Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as large, blinking stupidly in the sunlight, swinging their new Beaters’ bats.",5
"“I don’t want you to make him apologize,” Lily shouted, rounding on James.",5
The news about his shouting match with Umbridge seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards.,5
"“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I’m a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?” Harry said loudly.",5
"Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went.",5
"It’s forty-ten, forty- ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle...”  Harry could hear Luna’s ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened; only thirty points in it, that was nothing, they could pull back easily.",5
"“Come on,” said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.",5
"“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas,” said George.",5
"Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most ... it was hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the other.",5
"“Mind you, the whole subjects useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better...” “How can you say that?” Hermione demanded.",5
“We need more height... Give it another quarter of a mile!” Harry’s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps.,5
"“Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,” said Dumbledore.",5
"“We can take off his name and put yours on instead...” As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.",5
Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore.,6
"“I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me.",6
"“And so have you, Harry!” “When, History of Magic?",6
Who’s bin cursed — not Ron?,6
"“You didn’t meet him, Hermione.",6
"So tell me, while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here?",6
"“We all ran forward — those of us who were still standing anyway — and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust — obviously, none of us attacked them — ” “We just let them pass,” said Tonks in a hollow voice.",6
"“Yeah ... yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don’t we?",6
"The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry’s heart, however, was still pounding.",6
"“Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?” But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork.",6
"“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl.",6
"The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.",6
Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview.,6
"“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite — ah — safe in my hands.” “I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, frowning.",6
"But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they?” Harry said nothing.",6
"“I hope you’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?” “Yes, thanks, sir,” said Harry.",6
"Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid’s arms.",6
"“I, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!” “Yes, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored voice.",6
"That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.” “What do you mean?” “I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin.",6
"“Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I?",6
“What are you — ?” But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak.,6
The cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry.,6
It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.,6
"However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise.",6
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.,6
"“What did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?” “Oh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,” said Hermione.",6
"“Just get up by the goal posts!” Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.",6
"There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd.",6
"...” And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall.",6
"Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish.",6
"He turned away and caught Ron’s eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.",6
"“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an object outside the body.",6
"We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary — ” “What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at last.",6
"“Couldn’t your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?” “It’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice.",6
"After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.",6
"Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too.",6
"“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore.",6
"Harry, I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C. Sincerely, Professor H. E. F. Slug horn “Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked Neville, looking perplexedly at his own invitation.",6
"“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed.",6
"“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said.",6
"“Not here, precisely,” said Dumbledore.",6
"“I’m not hurt,” said Harry.",6
"“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead.",6
"The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.",6
"“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him.",6
"Feeling both panicky and close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, “Good evening.",6
"“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron.",6
“Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother’s gift.,6
"Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes.",6
Drink up.” Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke sharply.,6
"Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.” “Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.",6
"...” “Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, “but my friend Ron’s swallowed a love potion by mistake.",6
"After a moment he said, “Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old — ” “Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn’t do?” asked Harry angrily.",6
"...” “Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,” said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.",6
"Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.",6
"Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at.",6
"The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs ... then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse.",6
"He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed.",6
He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all.,6
And in any case .,6
"“Is it definite, is he using them?” “The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said Snape, “which means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again.",6
"“Gives light only to the holder, remember?” “Anyway,” Ginny went on, “he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black — ” “ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said Ron bitterly.",6
"“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him.",6
"Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all.",6
"At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione.",6
Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm.,6
"There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s throat.",6
Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.,6
"Have I missed breakfast?” “Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, rolling his eyes.",6
"“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched.",6
Harry and his dad were just having a laugh.,6
perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead .,6
"“Oh ... right ... Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair.",6
Will it help me .,6
"“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly.",6
He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done.,6
"No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.”  “It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said Harry.",6
"He’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.” “There will be no need for — ” “I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy.",6
"“Well, of course, I daresay he’s busy,” said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby.",6
"I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.” None of the Dursleys said anything.",6
"People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far.",6
% who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you told me he said.,6
"“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.",6
"Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask.",6
"“We’ll have them rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to know!” And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait just one moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.",6
"I’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.” Neville looked miserable and muttered something about “my grandmother wants.” “Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall.",6
"In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.",6
Dumbledore ’s right hand was as blackened and dead- looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys.,6
The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron?,6
We’re testing most of our products on ourselves.” Hermione looked nervous.,6
"Harry turned to face him, frowning.",6
I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my  successor.,6
"He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.” “Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of Gryffindor’s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,” said Harry, counting on his fingers.",6
"This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry’s mind as he fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb.",6
... We had lots in common.,6
"“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.",6
"Should I do mine too?” “No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake.",6
"“It’s McGonagall’s orders,” said Ginny.",6
"Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledore’s last excursion from Hogwarts.",6
"Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.”  Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it.",6
"...” “That’s settled, then,” said Harry.",6
"He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves.",6
"“One for Harry ...” said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, ""... and one for me.",6
"He hardly ever cried, you know.",6
"“But we’re not selling them to our sister,” he added, becoming suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about five boys on the go from what we’ve — ” “Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf.",6
Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.,6
"Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.",6
"“ Who are you, then?” “I’m Morfin, ain’t 1?” “ Marvolo’ s son?” “ ’Course I am, then ...”  Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on his right hand.",6
"“He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see.",6
"He felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but  as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.",6
"“Lupin said they would,” said Ron.",6
"“Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but — ” “Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern.",6
"“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.",6
"...” He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, “And you, Potter ... You wait here for me.” It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey.",6
"The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells.",6
"“The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,” she said coldly.",6
"Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this.",6
"Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent.",6
"And even if Snape pretended it hadn’t been his, Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once.",6
"Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet — Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them — for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.",6
"... Give Aragog a better send-off, you know ...” “Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm.",6
"Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know.",6
"Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once.",6
...” Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation.,6
"“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she replied, waving at them as she left.",6
"“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching.",6
"They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.",6
"“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore.",6
A — a Horcrux?” Harry shook his head.,6
"Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister.",6
"“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I would not find a group of them — Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov — awaiting your return?",6
"“The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter.",6
"Ask for Tom the barman — easy enough to remember, as he shares your name — ” Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.",6
"“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore.",6
"Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.",6
"There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie’s fate had not yet spread.",6
"He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour tonight.",6
"“Come on, would I?” “How could she think I’d like something like that, though?” Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.",6
"Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips.",6
"Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore, who, incredibly, smiled.",6
It seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.,6
"... “Thank you, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly.",6
Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa.,6
"“Is that you, Fenrir?” asked Dumbledore.",6
"If it were to help you, of course ... but no purpose can be served ...” “It can,” said Harry clearly.",6
"“So that’s how you thought you’d persuade me, is it?",6
“He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me.,6
"“Bill and I are going to be married!” “Oh,” said Harry blankly.",6
Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen- year-olds.,6
"Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team.",6
"“Molly — Arthur — ” said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them.",6
"At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door.",6
"Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now.",6
"When he could stand it no longer he said, “Professor  Dumbledore, I’m really sorry.",6
"“Same as he wanted at Christmas,” shrugged Harry.",6
He set Dawlish to tail me.,6
"I’ll knock off the Knut.” “But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!” “You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.” Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.",6
"THREE!” Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over.",6
"Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him.",6
Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.,6
"“But he doesn’ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they’d ’ve bin caught, wouldn’ they?",6
"They have allowed us to raise the boat.” “But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.",6
"All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.",6
"The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts.",6
“I just wish I’d asked you sooner.,6
"“Professor, what happened to your — ?” “I have no time to explain now,” said Dumbledore.",6
"Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the water’s edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.",6
"“Bad luck, mate, but you’ll pass next time — we can take it together.” “Yeah, I s’pose,” said Ron grumpily.",6
"I think he was born here in the orphanage?” “That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin.",6
But I do not think ...,6
“I had Hokey bring it out for me.,6
"Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human.",6
But he was not sure how he felt about it.,6
"“You will come out of retirement?” “Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently.",6
"“No thanks,” said Harry quickly.",6
"But even from above  there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks.",6
"“That’s neither here nor there,” said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise.",6
Harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened.,6
"Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people’s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.” Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who bit me.” “What?” said Harry, astonished.",6
"His immediate thought was that someone, surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again.",6
"“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend Sanguini.” Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded.",6
They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was.,6
"Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledore ’s mouth, the water vanished again.",6
"McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.",6
It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment.,6
"Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect.",6
"But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.",6
“ You look mighty like that Muggle .” “What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply.,6
"An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper.",6
“I’m going for help!” He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.,6
"For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.",6
"“But isn’t it ... sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?” Dumbledore bowed his head.",6
I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me.,6
“I heard Goyle’s trunk hit you.,6
"“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said anxiously, when Harry and Ron joined her.",6
I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage!,6
"“But sir, I heard people talking — ” “If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.” “I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione.",6
"The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry’s sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore ’s most prized possessions.",6
What would happen to it next?,6
“The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor.,6
"“What did you tell her?”  “I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail,” said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly.",6
"“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter.",6
All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.,6
"“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically.",6
There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface.,6
She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined.,6
"... “Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation.",6
"An immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous.",6
"“I am — that’s to say, I was — ” “Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour.",6
"“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to turn you against Horace — or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your guard.",6
"Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.",6
“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry’s doing a wonderful job.” Dumbledore smiled.,6
"None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however.",6
"Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf.",6
"ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name — Lord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince — how could Dumbledore have missed — ?” He broke off, looking out the window.",6
"“He wouldn’t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know.",6
"survive?” “It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next day’s weather, “and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.” Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door.",6
"I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party ... well, I followed them, actually.",6
Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.,6
...” Malfoy stared at Dumbledore.,6
"“Do you remember, Arthur?” “Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling.",6
"“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly.",6
"“So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t know?” “They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry’s face.",6
"“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me — ” The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.",6
"There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.",6
"It was all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.",6
"“I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.” “You are mistaken,” said Voldemort.",6
"“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry.",6
"Harry reached out, straightened the half- moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve.",6
"When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin’s release from Azkaban.",6
"Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread,  swirling like gas.",6
“And it takes six months ... You’ve got to let it stew.,6
I may be close to finding another one.,6
"“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get to know ’is family properly.",6
"Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses.",6
"If he’d just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be ... Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.” Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.",6
"...” “What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him.",6
And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named either.,6
"“I don’t think that’ll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it’s a clever ruse.",6
"He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring  soundlessly.",6
"The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front: AMULETS Effective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.",6
"“That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,” said Dumbledore lightly.",6
"“Step three,” called Twycross, “and only when I give the command ...",6
"“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red.",6
"And — forgive me — you speak of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers, were you not?” “They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!” snarled Bellatrix.",6
"We’re his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?” “Mr.",6
"“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione.",6
"“Dumbledore’s told us how you saved him with the bezoar,” she sobbed.",6
"“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he’s — ” He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.",6
"It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high.",6
"Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old- fashioned London street.",6
"He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however.",6
"I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up.",6
"“Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?” “ Stupe — ” “Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!” sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more.",6
"Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good.” “One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, “and she’s the best in our year.” “Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said Slughorn.",6
And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map.,6
"“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” hiccuped Slughorn happily.",6
"Same goes for you, Avery.” Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out.",6
"Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.",6
"Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned.",6
You are forgetting what I have showed you.,6
He closed his eyes for a moment.,6
"Hoping to see you this Friday, I am, yours most sincerely, Albus Dumbledore Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o’clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive.",6
"Within seconds he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray.",6
"“When — when you were a kid, you mean?” “Yes.",6
"“I don’t want to intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t wanted to see you all so badly.",6
"“There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed.",6
"“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends!",6
"Mind, I don’ suppose yeh’d care, would yeh, not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag — ” “Don’t try and make me feel guilty, it won’t work!” said Harry forcefully.",6
Potter belongs to the Dark Lord — we are to leave him!,6
"When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got?",6
"“I heard that you had become headmaster,” he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been.",6
Hermione’s expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class.,6
"“Right under your nose and you never realized!”  “Ingenious,” said Dumbledore.",6
"It so happens that I trust Professor Snape — ” “Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered Malfoy.",6
“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt.,6
"“But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it’s landed him!",6
Silence fell over the queue immediately.,6
"“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.",6
Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there.,6
"You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal.” “What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded Ron.",6
"“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,” she said coldly.",6
"...” “I — well,” said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes.",6
"His heart leapt: Somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help — and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street toward them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing gown embroidered with dragons.",6
"Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron’s neck.",6
Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.,6
"“Why?” said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore’s face.",6
"Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured “Aguamenti’ too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.",6
"“Well, don’t let me keep ya.” And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.",6
"“Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing.",6
Covered in rags and pretty far along ...,6
Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you.” Malfoy winced at the sound of the name.,6
"Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards.",6
"“I s’pose you think I cheated?” he finished, aggravated by her expression.",6
"Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened, she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny’s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and  frightened-looking, until at last they had been allowed in to see him.",6
"Back on his feet in no time.” “Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same.",6
Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly.,6
"Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew you were going to say that.",6
He’s much happier than he was in the forest.,6
Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look.,6
"He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest: This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.",6
"This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard.",6
"After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.",6
"As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage.",6
“What do I care how he looks?,6
"Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand.",6
"Harry felt frustrated beyond belief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there.",6
"“A bad boy who — who — ” He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it; Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast.",6
“I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did.,6
"Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.” “Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” choked Narcissa.",6
“I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons!,6
"“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing.",6
"Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him, thinking.",6
"“You flew really well — ” “You did brilliantly, Ron!” This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face.",6
"“What do you mean, ‘’e was going to be married?’ ” Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled.",6
"His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.",6
"Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.",6
"The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.",6
"“Well, have a lovely term, Ron.",6
“You did not do as I asked.,6
"On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library, and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunchtime, Hermione dropped into  the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.",6
"“Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,” said Slughorn bluntly.",6
He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company.,6
“Lemme see her!” “Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne.,6
"“I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.” “The locket maybe,” said Harry, “but why take the cup as well?” “It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” said Dumbledore.",6
"An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good- bye by his own mother, not Ron’s?",6
"Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.",6
The front door was hanging off its hinges.,6
"There were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves.",6
“Oh ... right ...” said Harry quickly.,6
"“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to see the team that Potter’s put together this year.",6
"However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just in case.” Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within.",6
"Had Ron, Hermione, and Ginny’s luck run out by now?",6
It is one of the irritating things about old teachers.,6
"“I mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party with her, but she never said ... just as friends ... I’m a free agent.",6
"“He trusts you so, Severus.",6
"“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?” Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.",6
“Gimme that!” Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.,6
"“Defense Against the Dark Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act?",6
Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply.,6
“And time’s ... up!” called Slughorn.,6
"“Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?” “Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?” “Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid.",6
"Oh yes, there you are — take that away now, Hokey.” The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.",6
"I — I’ve got a job to do.” “Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” said Dumbledore softly.",6
"“Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink.” Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.",6
"Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period Ancient Runes class without further ado.",6
“It’s just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book.,6
"The silent seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had vanished.",6
He could not pretend now that he was not scared.,6
"“This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?” said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light.",6
"“Ten points from Gryffindor.” Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron; half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them.",6
"“And did the voice say who was there?” “No, it did not,” she said.",6
"He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.",6
"Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.” “Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock — ” “I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins entered the kitchen.",6
“Stop.” Riddle spoke in Parseltongue.,6
"I’m pretty tired now ... see you The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katie’s attack had done.",6
"“Or d’you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?”  “It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously.",6
"“Do you have any proof?” “No,” said Harry, “but ...” and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr. Borgin.",6
"The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends.",6
"Although Harry much preferred this new laughing,  joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price.",6
“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked Dumbledore.,6
"“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans,” said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.",6
“I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure.,6
"Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words “Krum” and “can’t complain” again.",6
"She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.",6
"His face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.",6
"“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir?",6
"You’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!” “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.",6
"There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat’s ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys’ shag carpet and covered in grimy rags.",6
"“May I offer you a drink?”  “That would be welcome,” said Voldemort.",6
"I’ve got to try and kill him, or — ” “Got to?” said Dumbledore.",6
"He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: The smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone.",6
"“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched.",6
"Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.”  Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it.",6
"For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy’s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.",6
Harry’s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.,6
Will we be too heavy together?” Dumbledore chuckled.,6
"He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters — ” “The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion- Making.",6
"“That was different,” he said robustly.",6
"“So, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said Fred.",6
“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.,6
"“Dumbledore cornered!” he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly.",6
"He  clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: He looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the little man in black droned on.",6
"Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in  any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing.",6
"Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let Lavender hear you saying that.” “I won’t,” said Ron into his hands.",6
"“I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn’t there,” said Lupin.",6
"It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously.",6
"“But let’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.” A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.",6
"No, you’ll go far, Tom, I’ve never been wrong about a student yet.” The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn ’s desk chimed eleven o’clock behind him and he looked around.",6
"Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes.",6
"“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from — ” Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too.",6
"In spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much.",6
It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.,6
On Ministry of Magic premises.,6
"A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past.",6
"“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron.",6
"It is Voldemort ’s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the  slightest desire to become one of Voldemort’s followers!” “Of course I haven’t!” said Harry indignantly.",6
He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.,6
"“Did you see the Malfoys?” “Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned.",6
"The castle’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff.",6
"If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate?",6
“It’s natural to feel some curiosity about these things.,6
I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate.,6
"Hagrid’s chair was deserted too; Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast, but Snape’s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour.",6
... Have a look in the book ...” Harry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and looked up Felix Felicis.,6
"Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy.",6
"“There you are then,” said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each before raising his own.",6
"“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted.",6
"“Why don’t those three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone’s schoolbooks?” “I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack.",6
"As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over — but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.",6
"“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore’s office.",6
"“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look.",6
Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was.,6
...” She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.,6
"I’m planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day.",6
I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever.,6
"Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as  Dumbledore ’s, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.",6
"The point is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.” “At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously.",6
"Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious.",6
I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly.,6
"They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.",6
"...” “Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street.",6
"“Don’t drink that, Ron!” Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.",6
Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn ’s office.,6
"Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees.",6
The diary had been a Horcrux.,6
"... Well, I can’t fault you.",6
"Leave me alone!” The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street.",6
"To ten Galleons a hair!”  And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.",6
"Oh ... okay ...” Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, “Accio Horcruxl” With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface.",6
"Hermione?” “No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way ...” Together they ran back along the lane.",6
"“Blood, if I am not much mistaken.” “Blood?” “I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected.",6
"He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.",6
"By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others.",6
Aubrey’s head twice normal size.,6
“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful.,6
"“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste.",6
"“Not exactly, sir,” said Riddle.",6
"“Ten o’clock Saturday morning, Potter.",6
"... “Nearly there,” said Dumbledore cheerfully.",6
"Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast.",6
"Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.” “But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix.",6
"They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, “This is a joke, right?",6
"“I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.” “Of course.” “Be sure to understand me, Harry.",6
I think ... perhaps ...,6
Harry watched her with his mind a long way away.,6
"The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate.",6
Shall we?” Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.,6
"“He was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think.",6
"“ You know?” “Certainly,” said Snape.",6
"Good lord, it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s talent.",6
"“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done  him a great personal wrong, “we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.” Hagrid gave another great snort.",6
"“Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise.",6
"“They did,” said Fudge wearily.",6
"“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe.",6
“No wonder he wasn’t pleased to see me!,6
We wondered whether she came from a circus — and she said the boy’s surname was to be Riddle.,6
And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all.,6
"The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action ... oh, on the Dark Lord’s orders, of course!” Snape did not look at Bellatrix.",6
"“Every Auror in the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!”  “So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took.",6
"... Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d been Imperiused and I didn’t realize!” Leanne shook with renewed sobs.",6
"There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published.",6
"“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts.",6
"WRONG!” He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.",6
Dumbledore glanced up and down the street.,6
Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny ’s and Hermione’s laps.,6
"“Sir — how did you injure your hand?” Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.",6
He had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died.,6
"He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.” At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last.",6
"“Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.",6
"And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just left.",6
"“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he squeaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look.",6
This was a good decision: The first ten was made up of first years and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before.,6
"...” Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn’t.",6
...” There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron’s voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly.,6
"Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively.",6
"I could do with some sleep.” She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other two, and departed for the girls’ dormitories.",6
"Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school.",6
"How is he?” “Not bad,” said Harry.",6
“I am Professor Dumbledore.”  “ ‘Professor?” repeated Riddle.,6
"The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents.",6
"“I don’t like it much.” “Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands.",6
"And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.” “And then what?” said Ron.",6
"“Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped Hermione.",6
"I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time — ” “Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGonagall.",6
"He waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering, “Hello ... you’re very pretty, aren’t you?” Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor.",6
"He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast.",6
"“And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!” And with that, she stormed away.",6
"The Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ...” “You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your people were — were involved in those — those things, were they?” Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look.",6
"Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her.",6
"“But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night.",6
He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion’s fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink.,6
"“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady.",6
"But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished.",6
"As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face.",6
"...” “Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join.",6
"Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”  “Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl.",6
"“What made you?” “He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed Harry.",6
“You just put something in that drink.” “Excuse me?” said Harry.,6
"“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, “then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.",6
There are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials — Rosalind Antigone Bungs .,6
"Hermione, you left your stuff.",6
"What do you think, Potter?” “I — I don’t agree, sir,” said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape ’s eyes.",6
"Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children.",6
"They were standing alone at the Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley.",6
"Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence.",6
"“I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” he said darkly.",6
When he reached his destination he found it deserted.,6
"Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door.",6
“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron.,6
Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.,6
"I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff  immediately.",6
"“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half- Blood Prince?” “The Half-Blood what?” “Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.",6
"“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.",6
"You could just use your wand and then well be free too!” “No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously.",6
"Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate.",6
"The Pensieve  was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.",6
"“And they grow into ... ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive.",6
"“Professor Snape made a terrible — ”  “Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!” “Please let me finish.” Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly, then went on.",6
He raised a hand and felt it gingerly.,6
"Well done, Draco, well done!” “Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party.",6
something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s .,6
"“Ill do it, I’m — ” He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter?",6
His voice had changed completely.,6
“But he knows it now.,6
I still don’t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered.,6
"No, no, these are manners,” replied Dumbledore.",6
"“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth.",6
"Of course, that made it near enough priceless.",6
"Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow.",6
"“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room.",6
"“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,” said Ron reasonably.",6
"“We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — Aragog’s dead.",6
“Perhaps this will make you more confident.” He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet.,6
"“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard.",6
"These pictures” — he indicated a few of them as he swept past — “give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s Kiss” — a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall — “or provoke the aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the ground.",6
So what does that mean?,6
"“I’m very sorry,” he said finally.",6
"“Well, a very happy birthday, Ralph — ” “Ron — ” whispered Harry.",6
Ron looked rather pleased with himself.,6
... Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it.,6
"“No, no, Filch, they’re with me!” she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft.",6
Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.,6
"“ ‘Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity.",6
Twycross did not seem discouraged.,6
She said the locket had been Slytherin’s.,6
"Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore’s orders, Dumbledore owes him, he can’t leave him in this state — ” “Ron — Dumbledore’s dead,” said Ginny.",6
"Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised.",6
"Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.",6
"“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know.",6
“Do something!” But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock.,6
"Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore ’s body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.",6
"“Here,” said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry.",6
"“Once and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?” “Couldn’t — ?” “Do I have it?” “But — ” “ Your word, Harry.” “I — all right, but — ” Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion.",6
"But you don’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into.” “There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively.",6
"“I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,” said Dumbledore at last.",6
I  think he’s been branded with the Dark Mark.,6
"“They do not call me Tom’ anymore,” he said.",6
It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons.,6
"Didn’t like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an’ tried not ter listen, but it was a — well, a heated discussion an’ it wasn’ easy ter block it out.” “Well?” Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.",6
Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs.,6
“He wants something mended .,6
"One by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and examined them.",6
"“You’re not setting a great example!” McLaggen shouted back, red-faced and furious.",6
"More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.",6
"It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time: He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory.",6
"’ And that, apparently, was all he ever said again.",6
"Well, the answer’s no, Albus.” He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.",6
"“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?” The girl nodded.",6
"grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy.",6
"“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid.",6
"“Aaargh, the good die young,” muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain.",6
"“You will stay here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.” She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.",6
"Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.",6
A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes.,6
He wished he had eaten less breakfast.,6
"With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.",6
"""... and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again!” Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.",6
"Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harry’s trembling hands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead ...” “Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot.",6
We know some of it got stolen.,6
"There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard.",6
"“Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person.",6
"“You may,” said Professor McGonagall.",6
"As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent.",6
"However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement.",6
"“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders.",6
"Perhaps he’ll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty Squibs.",6
"A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg.",6
"“I’m a ruddy teacher, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” said Hagrid, firing up at once.",6
"Scrimgeour looked annoyed, but as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding.",6
"“All that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I had proof Snape was too — ” “ ‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said Hermione quietly.",6
And we’ll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.” Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors.,6
"His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.” “The diary wasn’t that special.” “The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.” “So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry.",6
"“Just because I’ve given my permission doesn’t mean I can’t withdraw it — ” “ ‘Your permission,’ ” scoffed Ginny.",6
"What is it you’re after, Tom?",6
"“Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul.",6
"And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world .",6
"“And an arrest.” “Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange.",6
"Harry felt Dumbledore ’s hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together  on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore’s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.",6
And you resorted to crude and  badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands .,6
"Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur’s feet.",6
"Muggles and filth.” Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once.",6
"“You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble.",6
“He’d done what he’d meant to do.” They all fell silent.,6
"You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I’m sure we can lend you some scales, and we’ve got a small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts.",6
“I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didn’t.,6
"“The Minister ... and by the looks of it, he’s brought a delegation ...” “Can I leave, Professor?” said Harry at once.",6
"He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake.",6
"Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral.",6
"Guess what?” he added, turning to Harry.",6
"... Wouldn’t hear a word against him!” “I’d love to know what Snape told him to convince him,” said Tonks.",6
"“He will have to return here, at the very least, every summer.” “Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup.",6
"“Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either.",6
"Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they?",6
"I just can’t get the hang of Apparition.” “You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,” said Harry reasonably.",6
"“Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it to me.” There was a little silence.",6
"He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.",6
"“I think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on, a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, “why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer’s Stone.",6
"“I just — ” “Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip.",6
"...” He supported Dumbledore’s shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, “I want to die!",6
"Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open.",6
"“You naughty boy, you shouldn’t have!” squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table.",6
"“Mum, are there any more sausages?” Harry looked back down at his results.",6
“Haven’t you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?” asked Fred.,6
"“It is natural to be afraid,” said Dumbledore.",6
"“Thank goodness, what an ’orrible — ” “Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet.",6
"But of course,” he answered his own question, “Rosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I’m sure.” “That’s right,” said Malfoy.",6
"“I’m to wait for you, any idea how long you 11 be?” “A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley.",6
He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them .,6
"“Harry,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning.",6
"“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?” she asked through gritted teeth.",6
"“Oh ... er ...” The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to give it.",6
"He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him.",6
"Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.",6
"...” “Sir, I wondered what you know about .",6
"She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry.",6
"The Great Hall, with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow.",6
"“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said.",6
"He’s older’n you, now I think on it.",6
"“I haven’t forgotten about Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn’t I find out what Malfoy’s doing?” “I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said Hermione.",6
"“You haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know “Essence of Insanity?” suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders.",6
"But it is my belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right — that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic.",6
It isn’t being ... kept for anyone?” Mr. Borgin squinted at her.,6
"Harry persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks.",6
"Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”  “But,” said Harry, bewildered, “but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other — ” “Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words!",6
"Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all ... and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy.",6
"“I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!” said Harry angrily.",6
"“I want to find McLaggen and kill him.” “I’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘overexertion,’ ” said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner.",6
"Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind.",6
"Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to  rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form.",6
"Merope had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale.",6
"“Madam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?” “You can’t go up there alone!",6
"He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him.",6
You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks ago — ” It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines and held them tight.,6
This younger Albus Dumbledore ’s long hair and beard were auburn.,6
“But — ” said Hermione.,6
"“Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of incomprehension.",6
“It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago.,6
"Can you keep a secret, Tom?",6
"Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.",6
"He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy ’s ... what could it be?",6
"...” “He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered McGonagall.",6
"There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight.",6
"“You should have seen what he gave me, first lesson,  Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think even you, Severus — ” “Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet.",6
"It was coming — as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough — from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.",6
"Dragon,” shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.",6
"What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast- Ended Skrewt.",6
"Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious.",6
The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable.,6
"He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.",6
"“Look,” said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, “we’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after break ... and after lunch ... excellent.” They returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.",6
"“Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.” He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’ ” Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius?",6
“He’s replaced his father as a Death Eater!”  There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter.,6
“Good luck!” cried a voice from the stands.,6
"Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkin’s.",6
"The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments reformed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.",6
"Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry’s suspicions?",6
Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.,6
"“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione.",6
"Ah ...” The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress’s elbow.",6
"You’re talking to the man who raised Fred and George.” “Er ... yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.” “Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.” “Well, we followed Draco Malfoy.",6
We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that’s where the Mark was.,6
"They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency.",6
“I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history.,6
"Dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh yes, he has,” (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord acknowledges it.",6
make him play at the top of his form .,6
"No?” McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.",6
"He hesitated a moment, then said, “Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?” “I dunno,” said Harry.",6
"Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your home from attack.",6
"“You’re in trouble, you are!",6
"For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you must.",6
"...” “And then Snape was there,” said Tonks, “and then he wasn’t — ” “I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eater’s jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things,” said Ginny.",6
"“In there,” whispered Ginny in Harry’s ear.",6
"“You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!”  “Er,” began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern.",6
Only if we are very unfortunate.” “You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?” “Oh no ...,6
"Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.",6
"“Did you have a good Christmas?” “Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim — ” “I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him.",6
"As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed.",6
"His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back.",6
"He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore ’s face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.",6
"“Gravy, Fleur?” In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.",6
“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole.,6
"When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared.",6
"She met Harry’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him.",6
"“Hmpf,” he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes.",6
... “She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match.,6
“I was just practicing.” “Yeah ... they’re — er — really good.,6
Harry recognized Voldemort at once.,6
“Will you let me return?,6
They’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects.,6
"“My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you didn’t ... ?” Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, “Well be starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.” They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos.",6
But if you don’t want to ...” He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to.,6
"Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting.",6
"“Unless he got both?” “I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore.",6
Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.,6
"And you” — he looked Lupin straight in the eye — “do you honestly like Snape?” “I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin.",6
Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting.,6
"You think You-Know- Who would let Malfoy join?” “It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice.",6
"Hi, Luna!” “What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare.",6
"This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government’s fault.",6
"“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently.",6
"“Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?” “Yep,” said Harry.",6
“Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?” said Ron eagerly.,6
"“One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all.",6
"Fawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows.",6
"The fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks.",6
"Harry, quickly ...” Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor.",6
"“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the headmaster’s office.",6
"Two house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth.",6
"Personally, I don’t think we’re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can’t expect mothers to think like that.",6
"When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.",6
"“I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing.” Vernon Dursley said nothing at all.",6
"“I know what yeh’re like abou’ Snape, Harry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter go readin’ more inter this than there is.” “Look out,” said Hermione tersely.",6
"“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” said Dumbledore.",6
"The leaflet wasn’t very clear.” “They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly.",6
...” Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed.,6
"To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.",6
"Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.” These words did nothing to raise Harry’s morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, “Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s mistake ... Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.",6
"“I think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ” “That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn.",6
"“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows.",6
"Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn ’s open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron’s gargling breath filled the room.",6
"Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.",6
“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron.,6
"The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna.",6
"Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice.",6
"Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.",6
"He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour.",6
"... “When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry’s shoulder as he struggled to his feet.",6
He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out.,6
"Her father picked her up last night.” “What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione.",6
"“Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, “has a very beautiful tiara — goblin-made — which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you  for the wedding.",6
"“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily.",6
"“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said Harry, with a bitter laugh.",6
The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order.,6
"He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the Prince’s useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text.",6
"... Pheasant, Belby?” Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.",6
"“And in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close.",6
"“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered Ron.",6
"“Well, what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she asked, batting her lashes.",6
"“M’daughter, Merope,” said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her.",6
"We won!” Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him.",6
"“And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.” Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After you, Harry.” Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them.",6
Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else.,6
"Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle.",6
"... And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over.",6
"Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him.",6
"“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you an overview, of course.",6
"“You ask him!” “No, you!” “I’ll do it!”  And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.",6
"But then he heard music, strange, otherworldly music, and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it.",6
"His comprehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.",6
"“Ginny, listen ...” he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet, “I can’t be involved with you anymore.",6
Harry glanced around at their fellow guests.,6
"“But half an eyebrow\ Like that matters!” “I know,” said Hermione soothingly, “it does seem really harsh.",6
"In the  distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.",6
"Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then — CRACK — he Disapparated.",6
"“There’s only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that’s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal — ” “Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the book.",6
"“Today’s going to be a real doss, I reckon.” “Hold it!” said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand.",6
"When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil.",6
poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink.,6
"How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy?",6
"“When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re not going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’ ” There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class.",6
"... What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this — Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?",6
"Anyway, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn’t get in — you wouldn’t have wanted someone like that on the team.” “No,” said Harry.",6
"“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn.",6
I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer.,6
"“Apparently I underestimated you, Potter,” he said quietly.",6
"“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t they?",6
"...” Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face.",6
"He swore they’d just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I’m sure of it.",6
"Saying what?” “I don’t know that it was saying anything,” said Professor Trelawney.",6
"He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch.",6
"“Why did the love potion stop working?” “Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means.",6
"“Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.” “But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly.",6
"“Help yourself, Tom,” said Hepzibah, “I know how you love my cakes.",6
"Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.",6
"“Anyway,” said Slughorn, turning back to Harry.",6
“Madam — please — ” Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.,6
Why didn’t I think of it?” Harry stared at them both.,6
"“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?” “I will,” said Snape.",6
"It’s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know.",6
"She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.” “Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly.",6
"” “With her — ?” “She can’t change her appearance like she used to,” explained Hermione.",6
"“For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur.",6
“I have been looking for a very long time.,6
"“We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there.",6
“Nearly all of them are on Voldemort’s side.,6
“There’s a whole collection of old Prophets up there.,6
It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking.,6
"I’m from the Ministry of Magic “ You’re not welcome.” “Er — I’m sorry — I don’t understand you,” said Ogden nervously.",6
Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know.,6
"SPINNER’S END Many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Minister’s windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish- strewn banks.",6
"“What’s going — ?”  Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey’s office and muttered, “MuffliatoV’ so that she would not come running.",6
Something smells good — onion soup?”  Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.,6
"“Wish I’d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco.",6
"I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice, and  everything going dark and being thrown out of the room.",6
"The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence.",6
"There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.” “Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project.",6
"And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than your predecessor.",6
"He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him.",6
"“All right, all right, 111 do it!” Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.",6
It was packed with customers; Harry could not get near the  shelves.,6
“It’ll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway.,6
"“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction.",6
"“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate.",7
"Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops.",7
"Tell him from me he’s a git!” “Harry, don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified!",7
"“Oh, don’t you see now how sick it is, the way they’ve got to obey?” “Kreacher — stop, stop!” shouted Harry.",7
"Harry’s voice was still saying, “Dobby ... Dobby ...” even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back.",7
"Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.",7
His voice shook with the strain of not laughing.,7
"It looks like a giant rook!” “It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower.",7
They are camping in the Forest of Dean!,7
"and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord.",7
"The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins.",7
"“And if he survives Azkaban, you 11 have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends “Arthur,” Harry interrupted, “you know you’re being tracked, don’t you?” “Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly.",7
"Curious, he began to climb the stairs.",7
"The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him.",7
"Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on.",7
“He will have to move in the open.,7
"There’s a fake in there, isn’t there?",7
"“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students — ” “I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in anyone who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.” “There’s something in that,” she agreed.",7
"Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room.",7
Let’s try the next lot of hills.” So they Disapparated a few miles farther north.,7
"“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing height?” Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset.",7
"Couple of kids more or less, what’s the difference?” “Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate.",7
"As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had turned red.",7
"She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry’s face.",7
"Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry’s wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and Voldemort’s.",7
Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits.,7
"“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drowning man at a life belt.",7
"It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going.",7
“Why does my room have to be cleaned out?,7
"Harry turned away, smiling to himself.",7
"...” “Harry, you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore!” Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom.",7
"Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband’s crime she had faced in her former village.",7
“Couldn’t you see who was casting it?,7
"Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.",7
Going to cart me off to Azkaban?,7
"“Yeah ... well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.",7
"The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts.",7
"“Luna’s got ten times his guts.” “He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here,” said Harry.",7
“What do you mean?” he asked.,7
"“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured, “that they use decoys.",7
"“And then come back,” said Harry.",7
"“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there.",7
"And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook!",7
"Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain.",7
"""... at the time,” she finished in a whisper.",7
"Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed.",7
Perhaps she could open the door for you?,7
"“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist.",7
"...” Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.",7
"“Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?”  Once again, all heads turned.",7
The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition.,7
"“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,” he added to Hermione, standing up  and stretching.",7
"He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.",7
"He’s been providing us with food, because  for some reason, that’s the one thing the room doesn’t really do.” “Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment.",7
"I saw her picture in the Prophett Look, Draco, isn’t it the Granger girl?” “I ... maybe ... yeah.” “But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron.",7
till he came.” And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face.,7
"""... then I declare you bonded for life.” The tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures.",7
"There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow moving closer.",7
The castle was unnaturally silent.,7
"“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance.",7
"“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner.",7
"Here,” he pointed out the tiny wings, “a billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind.",7
"His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.",7
"Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.” “Hey!” James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.",7
"Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike.",7
"Saw your dad, though, Ron.",7
"Ron, show Harry what you’ve done.” “Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron.",7
"“I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub.",7
"Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid ’s arms.",7
"“Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me.",7
"She sounded terrified, but convincing.",7
"“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom.",7
“It’s really good of you to do this.,7
"“Duro\” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.",7
"“Harry, where’s Hedwig?” “She ... she got hit,” said Harry.",7
"“We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!” “Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron.",7
"“Neville.” “Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!” Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.",7
"On your head,” he said quietly, “be it.”  Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand.",7
"“We’re fighting.” There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and Harry’s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.",7
"You know, first holiday after they were married.",7
"“My Lord?” “Your wand, Lucius.",7
"She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him.",7
"...” Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students.",7
"I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times.",7
"“I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said Ron, looking down at his bare chest.",7
"Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s old girlfriend, Cho Chang.",7
"Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.",7
"HERMIONE!” “We need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these ropes off — ” “Harry?” came a whisper through the darkness.",7
"...” “Explain, then, what happened.",7
"“What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above.",7
... “Where are we?” said Ron’s voice.,7
“Bardy Weadley.” “A Weasley?” rasped Greyback.,7
"Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger.",7
"“When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!” “Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in his fingers.",7
"Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew — ” “I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them.",7
"He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.” “Yes ... and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously, “but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think — ”  “Well, why not?",7
"“Yes, I was!” “Well, you can’t say fairer than that,” said Fred, holding out his hand to Percy.",7
"“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall.",7
"“And how did you manage to get away?” “Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,” said Hermione.",7
"From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own.",7
The firewhisky seared Harry’s throat.,7
"She read it, then clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced.",7
"Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves.",7
"Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused.",7
“We don’t know what happened to anyone else.” She and Ted exchanged looks.,7
"Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves.",7
"Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to  hope for.",7
"And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.",7
"Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling.",7
He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye.,7
"I mean” — Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place — “why are we here?",7
"“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall.",7
The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it.,7
"They like punishment, the Carrows.” “Like Umbridge?” “Nah, they make her look tame.",7
Much also depends upon the wand itself.,7
"Didn’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?” “Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.” “Yeah ... maybe,” said Harry.",7
"But then, you must know what happened to it!”  “While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord — ” “Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” Harry said fiercely.",7
He didn’t want me to take it.,7
The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable — in all usual senses it was worthless — but because of what it had cost to attain it.,7
"“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know.",7
“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the tufty-haired wizard.,7
Harry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave.,7
"He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd.",7
...” She broke from him to free her wand arm.,7
"Take your hands off me!”  “This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy — ” “Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,” interjected Greyback, “but it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us that 11 be claiming the gold — ” “Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand.",7
"“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes.",7
I shall try to help you.”  He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close.,7
... Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.,7
"If you read this, Harry, we’re all behind you!",7
“Bill had a real knack for guessing them.,7
"And wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years?",7
"“No, no, I’m half-blood, I’m half-blood, I tell you!",7
"He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down — kill them all — ” “If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord Voldemort will spare her?",7
"I’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own kid, actually.” Lupin’s face drained of color.",7
"When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, “That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.” “Oh, it’s nothing, dear,” she said fondly.",7
"“They’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they’ve been working with you.” “I can’t leave,” said Harry.",7
"He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold him).",7
"He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold.",7
I’m descended from the third brother!,7
The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them.,7
“Why didn’t we think of snow?,7
"He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies.",7
"... And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door.",7
"If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.” “We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval.",7
Hmm.” His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar.,7
"“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!” “I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s “ — attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him.",7
“I always said he was mental.,7
"Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.",7
"They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.",7
"“All that ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ‘Magic Is Might’ all over again.",7
“Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours.,7
They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen.,7
On the count of three.,7
"There isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty.",7
“I just did a Summoning Charm.,7
"“They’ve been treated brutally in the past.” “Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?” said Ron.",7
"Harry’s favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.",7
“Grindelwald didn’t like that at all.,7
"“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard.",7
Some of them have been my own.,7
"Harry’s wandlight passed over shields and goblin- made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly  it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.",7
"“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran.",7
The evidence is that she died several months ago.,7
"Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack.",7
"Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out.",7
"Can you control what you dream about, Hermione?” “If you just learned to apply Occlumency — ” But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had just seen.",7
"She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly  parted, her eyes wide.",7
He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak.,7
There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him.,7
"Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it.",7
"She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force.",7
"He had made his choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust.",7
"“ — Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on remorselessly.",7
"“Hermionel” She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face.",7
"“So ...” “So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup.",7
"So is this what you’ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch?",7
"Oh, I love her, always read her!” Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand.",7
"I — I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I’d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm’s protection.",7
"“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty.",7
It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once.,7
"Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers.",7
"“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window.",7
"“Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice, he did.",7
"Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them — And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack.",7
"Open the door!” The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified.",7
"“Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.” “HARRY!” Hermione screamed.",7
"On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched.",7
"This is insane — ” “We’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon.",7
"Pick up your little friend, Hagrid.",7
Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.”  Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror.,7
They say ‘For the Greater Good’ was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.” “What’s Nurmengard?”  “The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents.,7
With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing.,7
He made Kreacher drink all the potion.,7
"Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.” Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places.",7
"“ ‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him.",7
The place has never been so heavily guarded.,7
"“He changed, Harry, he changed!",7
Surely it would need sustenance before long?,7
"So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him.",7
"No antlers.” Harry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron again.",7
"Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of goblets, and the sound of chewing.",7
You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.” Ron turned his back on the Burrow.,7
"“We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see.",7
"He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute.",7
"“A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you.",7
"The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat.",7
"Tut, tut ... even here, in the heart of the Ministry!” She stepped into the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening to Umbridge’s conversation with the Minister.",7
"“I — I think it’s started opening again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to — ”  “But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly.",7
It’s all down to Neville.,7
What happened when she took you upstairs?,7
"“ ‘The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.’ ” “People won’t let this happen,” said Ron.",7
"There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.",7
"And you still expect us to cooperate with you!” “You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his feet too.",7
"“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick.",7
"A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix’s side, there was no means for Harry to communicate with  Hermione or Ron.",7
"“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape.",7
He will want to stop it at any cost.,7
Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him.,7
"He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.",7
"“I would not have it ripped apart on my account.” “And my soul, Dumbledore?",7
"“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness.",7
"“I must — today — must go — ” “But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed.",7
"The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the family — don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of Harry’s expression.",7
He turned away and ran up the marble staircase.,7
Harry understood and yet did not understand.,7
"His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.”  Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.",7
“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked.,7
"That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or  crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick.",7
"All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch.",7
"The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found!",7
"Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty.",7
“You won’t be able to kill any of them ever again.,7
"“I don’t think it means anything new has happened, anything we don’t know about; think, Ron, Bill’s  already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you’re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I’m sure that’s all he meant — ” “Oh, you’re sure, are you?",7
"People are dying — I was nearly one of them — Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there?",7
Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared.,7
It explained much of his undetected wrong-doing at school!,7
We’re here.” They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage.,7
"“He’s me, see?” said Ron.",7
"Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada KedavraY’ again.",7
"Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do — A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione.",7
"“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?” Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her.",7
"Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.",7
The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act.,7
"Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther into the house.",7
"... And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived.",7
"They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as  Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it — They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track.",7
"I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.",7
The weather grew colder and colder.,7
"“Get up, vermin.” Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground.",7
"The Resurrection Stone — to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi!",7
"Harry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas.",7
"He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard.",7
"However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels.",7
"And Snargaluff pods ... yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.” “I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity.",7
"They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort’s.",7
"...” “I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave.",7
Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented.,7
"Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.",7
"“The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.” “All the better,” said Voldemort.",7
"“Didn’t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?” “I forge’ the details,” Hagrid chortled.",7
"He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered.",7
"Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation.",7
"And now something very strange happened, as we know.",7
He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid.,7
"There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper.",7
"Then Snape said, “I thought ... all these years .",7
‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’  Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly blurred.,7
"“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron.",7
"It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all “Oh, did he now?",7
"I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.” “Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione.",7
"And so does Voldemort, Hermione!",7
"Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?",7
"“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!”  Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory.",7
"One Horcrux down, mate!” Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first.",7
"Understand?” “Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter.",7
"“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he bowed low, muttering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood — ” “I forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor’ or ‘Mudblood,’ ” growled Harry.",7
"I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved — I hear Voldemort has recruited him?",7
"Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.",7
It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs.,7
"I thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least — ” “Harry, what if Bathilda’ s got the sword?",7
"“A desperate man’s dream!” “But they’re real!” “Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore.",7
"“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, “Dobby has come to rescue you.”  “But how did you — ?” An awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione was being tortured again.",7
“Have you seen what they’re sitting on?,7
"Harry’s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE.",7
"His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind.",7
"Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch.",7
"From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker: “Where do Vanished objects go?” “I dunno, do I?",7
He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice.,7
The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton.,7
The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood.,7
Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff.,7
We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD.,7
"Yet he no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing.",7
"Once you’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house, you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow.",7
"“Absolutely untrue!” “He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside.",7
that we were protecting him for her.,7
It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.,7
"“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again.",7
"Harry looked back at Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his decision: With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches.",7
"“No, I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore’s portrait.",7
"Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!” “Ill-informed sniping,” said Doge, turning radish- colored again.",7
"“Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib.",7
It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley’s file.,7
"“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said Ron.",7
"“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva?",7
"With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.",7
"For the first time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words.",7
"Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering.",7
"He’s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!” “Harry — ” “Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it?",7
"Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive.",7
"“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that tells the news like it really is.",7
"At once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again.",7
"One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier.",7
"... “But you have been misleading me, young woman!” said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione.",7
"“And I reckon he’s the real thing — the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.” “Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said Dirk, “me included.",7
"“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”  Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then it was gone.",7
"If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would’ve known how to get going with ... Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a lot.",7
I thought we would die in that place.,7
"The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus.",7
“They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us.,7
“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?” asked Hermione furiously.,7
"He took them and pulled them on: They were soft, clean, and warm.",7
"Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes.",7
"Then he said, “Yes.” “Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful.",7
And he told Kreacher — to go home — and never to tell my Mistress — what he had done — but to destroy — the first locket.,7
"“DOB — !” Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake.",7
"Come on.” They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them.",7
"He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart — “Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now!” “Very well.",7
"“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said.",7
"“Then, when she was fourteen ... See, I wasn’t there,” said Aberforth.",7
His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead.,7
"Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter — and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse.",7
"“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them.",7
"“I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said Harry.",7
"Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden.",7
I believed a different wand would work.,7
"As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor.",7
"Still feigning death on the ground, he understood.",7
Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away.,7
"He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge.",7
"The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival.",7
"But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter,  the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them.",7
"They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.",7
But I know better now.,7
I can tell by the look on your face!,7
"When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.",7
"I’ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for ...  “Lies!” Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously.",7
You have been very valuable to me.,7
"Harry could not see Fred’s body, because his family surrounded him.",7
Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away.,7
"“ Expelliarmusl” Hermione ’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand.",7
"Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup.",7
"We’re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.",7
"There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other.",7
"When he had finished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, Harry — ” “I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s true or — ” “Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter?",7
"I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.” “Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes.",7
"“And you tried to destroy it?” “Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the elf.",7
It was close to pitying.,7
Harry  glanced back as they crossed the threshold: The wizards were both scratching their heads.,7
Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle.,7
"“You’ve been ill,” she finished.",7
"“Well, then, why can’t they protect us?",7
"As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din.",7
“You probably don’t remember — ” Harry began.,7
"... And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart.",7
"“Most of the Order was there, they’ll look after everyone.” Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, “Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.",7
“She was really cut up when you ended it — ” “So was I.,7
"A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself.",7
"He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground.",7
I want to know the truth.,7
"“Snape was Dumbledore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother.",7
"“My Lord — ” Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed.",7
“We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione firmly.,7
“Keep her — them — safe.,7
Voldemort ’s expression did not change.,7
"They daren’t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted.",7
"“Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,” he added spitefully, “ you’re a Muggle.” Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone.",7
Harry pointed it at Hermione.,7
"It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there.",7
"“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally.",7
"“He took my blood,” said Harry.",7
“The S stands for Selwyn.,7
"He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision.",7
"Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security.",7
If the rest of your House could follow.” Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.,7
"Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge.",7
What are we going to do?” Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head.,7
"The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully.",7
"Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing.",7
"It is a copy — an excellent copy, it is true — but it was Wizard-made.",7
"Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.” Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up.",7
And guess what he’s doing?,7
These people are trying to capture and kill you!,7
"“And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you two-faced bastard!” Ron yelled.",7
"How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?” Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever.",7
"“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face.",7
“Y-you cast that doe?” “What?,7
“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron.,7
"Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.",7
"Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the — ” “He was never free,” said Harry.",7
"Dumbledore’s innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.",7
"To murder at the top of the highest tower ...  “All right,” he said quietly to the other two.",7
"Never once had he imagined Dumbledore ’s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old.",7
"While she unlocked the cafe door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the cafe’s light.",7
Very valuable.” “My Lord knows I seek only to serve him.,7
"All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t think it is!",7
"""... and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid the fire.",7
We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do.,7
A Christmas surprise for my Luna.,7
"Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.",7
"Fred and George turned to each other and said together, “Wow — we’re identical!” “I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking,” said Fred, examining his reflection in the kettle.",7
"Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift.",7
"“On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach.",7
"Then Snape spoke, and Harry’s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden.",7
"Dumbledore had  passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life!",7
"He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing .",7
"“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently.",7
“Did you think we’d be staying in five- star hotels?,7
"Far below, swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town.",7
Voldemort — he can fly — went straight for them.,7
Two young children came running into the hall.,7
"The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it ... And then, with a gasp, he remembered — “Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!” His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care.",7
"With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.",7
They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do.,7
"Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s — d-dead...?” Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears.",7
"Merlin’s beard,  what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing?",7
"You said he just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?” Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew.",7
To escape into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief.,7
"Have you seen my grandson?” “He’s fighting,” said Harry.",7
"Take care, Big D.” Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room.",7
"This isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in.",7
"As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.",7
"...” “You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!” “I swear I did not.",7
Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside.,7
"Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow.",7
"Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title: MUDBLOODS and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl.",7
"And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, “I can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay.",7
"The stairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness.",7
“You were yelling your head off!” said Ron.,7
"Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage.",7
"Not in that way.”  “I don’t understand.” “Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry’s.",7
"“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry’s inspection.",7
I’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman.,7
Harry had been afraid of the “concerned parent” attack.,7
"“And that one,” she pointed at an ancient sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s, they were supposed to be second.",7
"She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy.",7
He cut to the essentials.,7
"They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer.",7
"“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak.",7
"All the others are on You- Know- Who’s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you wait till you hear it, it’s great.",7
"If you can help us — well, now would be a great time to mention it.” Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s.",7
"“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly, most people!",7
"“But look at him carefully, look!",7
“But I might still be of some use to you.,7
"She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who.",7
“HARRY — WHERE’S HARRY?” Chaos reigned.,7
A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry’s chest.,7
A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral.,7
"“I know ’e’s swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up Scabior.",7
"“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger brother.",7
"Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry’s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved  momentarily.",7
“What request could a Death Eater make of me?” “The — the prophecy .,7
A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page.,7
"He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: “Stupefyl” Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor.",7
"Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone.",7
Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to.,7
Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years.,7
"“Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we’re going to end up when we go out.",7
"Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight.",7
"Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well- aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below.",7
"“So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?” “Hermione, I can’t.",7
"He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about Voldemort.",7
Harry took it and shook.,7
“What?” he snarled at Hermione.,7
"“We’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.” Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke.",7
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’ ... ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ ...” “Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling.",7
"... “ Accio Diadem).” cried Hermione in desperation, but nothing flew through the air toward them.",7
The atmosphere changed at once.,7
"She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high.",7
And we need the Clankers!” “Imperiol” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand.,7
"Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran.",7
"“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than  ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours.",7
It’s always been like that.,7
The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached.,7
We’ll leave you to get some rest now.” Ollivander looked stricken.,7
"Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort ’s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb.",7
"However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And what if we want to stay and fight?”  There was a smattering of applause.",7
"Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree.",7
"All I’ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!” “You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,” said Harry, stung.",7
"“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” Ron asked Hermione.",7
"“I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna.",7
Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs.,7
He looks fine.” Ron nodded his appreciation of this news.,7
“That was a nasty crash you just had.,7
"...” “Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus happily, striding into the living room.",7
Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry’s ears as she dragged him once more into darkness.,7
"Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm.",7
"“Yeah, that’s what we’ll do.",7
"After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione ’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago.",7
“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered.,7
“But — ” Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs.,7
He did not even know what all of them were.,7
At last Snape gave another curt nod.,7
"“Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of an achievement,” said Ted.",7
"It’s here at Hogwarts, but we don’t know where.",7
"Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never — ” “It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color.",7
They’ll know Sirius left you the place.” The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve.,7
"The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry’s feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves.",7
"He looked up at Hermione, whose bushy  hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them.",7
"Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?” “Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy.",7
"“Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it?",7
“We can do Diss-lusion Charms now!,7
You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts.,7
"Really!” “And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!” roared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius.",7
"That’s what Harry told her to do.” “Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his pillows.",7
Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone.,7
“My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak!,7
"Why not?” said Harry, abandoning caution.",7
He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing.,7
"Good, eh?” Harry merely looked his confusion.",7
“Protegol” The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione: The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor.,7
"... And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy.",7
There is so much you do not understand.,7
“I didn’t t-take it from anybody.,7
“Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?” “We only met him tonight!” Hermione sobbed.,7
"...” Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right.",7
"“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he drank from the black lake ... and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface.",7
"“His school?” “Yeah, his school!",7
Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix.,7
“Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione’s chair.),7
“The boy ... Is he dead?” There was complete silence in the clearing.,7
"“That was nothing,” said Snape.",7
"“If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you.",7
"“What is it?”  “Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy.",7
Harry’s scar was burning now.,7
"... Trouble is, I missed the last one.",7
“Or is he a relative?” he added with a glance at Harry’s red curly hair.,7
"Her face fell as she looked into Harry’s face: humor gone, terror replacing it.",7
"They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together.",7
“Yaxley — beside Dolohov.” The two men took their allotted places.,7
“What have you been doing?” “Look what I’ve just found.” He held out his mother’s letter.,7
"“Well, if all three of us go well have to Disapparate separately,” Ron was saying.",7
"Dad and Lupin ’ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it.",7
"“C-Crabbe ...” “He’s dead,” said Ron harshly.",7
"“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently.",7
"Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching  him for lack of tact.",7
"“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised and puffy.",7
"Looking directly at his father, he said, “Mad-Eye’s dead.” Nobody spoke, nobody moved.",7
"“ What ?” They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast.",7
"“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat.",7
"If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there.",7
The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey.,7
"Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond.",7
"You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.” “But I don’t despise you — ” “Then you should,” said Dumbledore.",7
"Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done.",7
"You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don’t care who we curse!”  Harry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness.",7
"The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort’s head.",7
"“We know Stan Shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.” There was another thud.",7
"He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig- strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest.",7
“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached.,7
The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust.,7
"She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!” “Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” said Hermione.",7
"“Harry, will you come in here a moment?” It was Ginny.",7
"His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with anxious expressions.",7
He was wearing the symbol at the wedding.,7
Wands only choose witches or wizards.,7
Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes.,7
"“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow.",7
"“I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by Side- Along- Apparition?” “Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely.",7
"And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been.",7
"“That wouldn’t have been effing difficult ... bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I?",7
"And yours, Lucius and Narcissa.",7
I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards — ” “Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry.,7
"The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase.",7
"With Bill’s warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery.",7
"If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.",7
"And don’t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband.",7
"Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father’s action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle- hater.",7
“I think that’s the worst bit.,7
"“He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything.",7
"“Look what he asked from me, Hermione!",7
Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed.,7
"Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools.",7
"He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.”  “I know.",7
"Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs.",7
"“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely.",7
There was a flash of green light — “Harry!,7
"“ ‘And Death spoke to them — ’ ” “Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?” “It’s a fairy tale, Harry!” “Right, sorry.",7
"“You can do it,” said Harry, “you can!",7
My dear boy!” Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s felt as though they had been thrust into icy water.,7
... He’s lost so much blood already.,7
"“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts.",7
"That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it?",7
"Easier to take, by far.” Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, “I shall attend to the boy in person.",7
"“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry.",7
"perhaps it had perished, like his parents, at Godric’s Hollow ... or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it.",7
He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm.,7
"“I came camping here once with my mum and dad.” Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the wind.",7
"“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts.",7
"“Our thoughts go with you.” “I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley.",7
"All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity.",7
"The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand.",7
"And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet.",7
“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down.,7
"“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lupin went on.",7
“Isn’t it still his?” “Perhaps not.,7
“I might not be able to save ’em a third time.” Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana’s portrait.,7
"“ ‘The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called “Muggle-borns,” the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets.",7
"...” Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus ’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration.",7
"It’s us we need to worry about.” “What do you mean?” “Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.” All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop.",7
"“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied.",7
"At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry.",7
"The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized.",7
"“Just — just show You- Know-Who some respect, will you?” “Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition.",7
"Is everyone okay?” “Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched.",7
"""... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.” “Voldemort needed an elf?” Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did.",7
Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him.,7
"She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.",7
"“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got to move!” he shook his head.",7
"... And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full of large, curved,  dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm.",7
He had barely read them when the words vanished again.,7
He could not fight the pain much longer: He had to succumb.,7
I understand those things that I did not understand before.,7
"“If I don’t turn up, my wife — I mean, Cattermole ’s wife — ” “Well come with you, we should stick together — ” began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly.",7
"“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?” Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked in front of Harry’s throat.",7
"Behind him came another scream, “Your wand, Selwyn, give me your wand\” He felt Voldemort before he saw him.",7
"“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him.",7
"“Good man — goblin, I should say,” amended Ted hastily.",7
"The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all.",7
"Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air.",7
"James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell — also, Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions.",7
"“Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided  Hogwarts could do without me after all.",7
"Made an excuse, did he?",7
This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.” “And this one?” Ollivander performed the same examination.,7
"“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand.",7
There were scurryings and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs.,7
We are the guardians of fabulous treasures.,7
"Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection.",7
"Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year’s travels, that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana.",7
They had found Gryffindor’s sword.,7
"You mean — ?” “The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest.",7
...” Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father.,7
"“He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!” “Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes — ” He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.",7
"Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone.",7
"He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break from wearing the Horcrux,  which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.",7
"Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father’s arrival, George stirred.",7
"“Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted.",7
“What’s the plan?” “Plan?” repeated Harry.,7
Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to look for the second sheet.,7
“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione.,7
He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.,7
"This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to  mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in.",7
"Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove.",7
"Voldemort stroked  the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.",7
"“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door.",7
"Saved me.” “Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently.",7
"Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky.",7
"That Dumbledore had told her to  wait, and that Harry would come in the end?",7
"“Well, well,” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official.",7
He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other.,7
"... Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course.",7
If they were mistaken .,7
"“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione.",7
"If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules.",7
"The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!” Griphook glared at them.",7
"And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast.",7
"The Mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im, ma’am.",7
Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying.,7
"Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape — ” “Let me — ”  “ — and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible.",7
"“Hi, Harry — you are Harry, right?” “Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.",7
We need to find out where the locket — where Master Regulus’s locket is.,7
He needed to deal with Griphook first.,7
"“Why can’t they help?” “What?” “They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between them, “We don’t know where it is.",7
“It means ... you know ... living beyond death.,7
"It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around.",7
"It was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like that, the moment he had wanted them.",7
"“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile.",7
"“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,” said Fred.",7
"“The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress say?” “I told you not to call her ‘Mudblood’!” snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing himself: He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor.",7
"It was so obvious, so clear to Harry: Everything fit, everything.",7
"He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move.",7
“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Dursley abruptly.,7
“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort’s press clippings.,7
Er — what’s happened to you?,7
"Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls.",7
"“Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries.",7
"We’ve never been spotted under it — ” “Of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron!” “But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they’re not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true!",7
"“Stay close to me,” he said quietly.",7
"Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles.",7
"“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again.",7
"He was really young when they — ” “Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.",7
Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him.,7
"Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene.",7
"“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step forward.",7
“She said she was saving it for when you got here.”  They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for work.,7
"Harry, come here.” For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door.",7
"He was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so as to watch Ginny’s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.",7
He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible.,7
"Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.",7
"“Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.” “Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds.",7
Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before.,7
"The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snout, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears.",7
"“You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.” “In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.",7
She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review.,7
Her face had a carved quality about it.,7
"“Gone ... dead ...” “Is this remorse, Severus?” “I wish ...",7
"Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.",7
"I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m afraid I cannot be party to — ” Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry.",7
"“She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill me.",7
Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained more?,7
"“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear.",7
"He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione.",7
Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.,7
"Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds.",7
... It’s the day before the wedding.,7
"You must not leave.” He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib.",7
"And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.",7
"How does that work, then?”  “While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object.",7
The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall.,7
"“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty- handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.",7
“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.,7
"I’ve fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm.",7
“And your first name?” “I — Vernon.,7
"“We know it’s Lupin\” “Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?” “I do,” said Lupin firmly.",7
"He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long; but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because Spellman’s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair.",7
"“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.",7
Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron’s deserted bunk.,7
"Nearly all the programs are following You-Know- Who’s line, all except Potterwatch.",7
I do not wish this to happen.,7
"Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite.",7
"He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it.",7
"Maybe once I’m there, I’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!” “I don’t — want — to — go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister’s grasp.",7
"He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving.",7
"“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her.",7
"’ ” “Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; Ron started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper.",7
"“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,” said Griphook finally, “it would be you, Harry Potter.",7
"“Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now.",7
More footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same spot.,7
Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon’s back.,7
"Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy.",7
"Might bring the place down.” “You lying piece of filth,” shouted the wizard named Selwyn.",7
I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.” “Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysterically.,7
"Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.",7
"“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.",7
Draco shook his head jerkily.,7
"“I’m Harry, Harry Potter.” Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s forehead.",7
"They didn’t know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery.",7
"“Percy, you can’t do anything for him!",7
He pulled it out and opened it.,7
"“You’ve already told someone this story, haven’t you?",7
His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above.,7
We thought you had a real plan\ He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right.,7
"Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before.",7
Mum’s getting edgy.” They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley.,7
"And then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light; Hermione ’s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again.",7
"The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resentful.",7
"Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled.",7
"“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl?",7
"“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward  brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness.",7
And I asked Teddy what he was doing — ” “You interrupted them?” said Ginny.,7
"“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, “is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?” And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor.",7
He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.,7
He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side.,7
“Harry ...” “ Where’s my wand?” She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him.,7
"They drew their wands, waiting.",7
"It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.” Dumbledore smiled.",7
"“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus.",7
The snake was ... was inside her.,7
"He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect Harry.",7
"He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar prickling.",7
"He said it the night he came back, I heard him.” Harry rubbed his scar.",7
"I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine.",7
“We need to recover it.” “Can’t it — ?” began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill.,7
"Indeed,  his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years.",7
"Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up.",7
"“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand.",7
"“Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch.",7
"Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments.",7
"More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit.",7
"He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.” Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him.",7
"Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!” “We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time, young man — ” “And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furiously.",7
Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat.,7
Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s ears were still scarlet.,7
"If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.” “Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that?” asked Ron.",7
"“Where are we?” “Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville.",7
"“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.",7
"At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana.",7
"“You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy?",7
"That’s — that’s not good, is it?” Ron gave a nervous laugh.",7
"Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors.",7
"“He ... he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve.",7
"Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.",7
"much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school — ” “Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately.",7
"1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously) “Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer.",7
"He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him.",7
"What’s happened, Cissy?” Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.",7
"“You’re kidding, right?” “No, I’m not!” said Hermione in surprise.",7
"With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate.",7
“Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle.,7
“We haven’t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin’s help.,7
"Listen — ” She caught her sister’s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away.",7
"The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son.",7
"Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.",7
"“Aguamenti\” screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.",7
And we ... we ...” Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach.,7
The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar.,7
"“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice.",7
"“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.",7
"Harry struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still — — as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room — The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane.",7
"You went sneaking  down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down there Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved?",7
“I need both of them here.,7
"“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans.",7
"“Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?” “Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er — bathroom.” Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again.",7
The lift doors clanged shut.,7
"They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites.",7
His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets.,7
"As Harry closed the door behind them, the old- fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway.",7
He seemed to be steeling himself.,7
"But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy.",7
“Just look around!” said Harry.,7
"Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door.",7
"“So what are we going to do?” “We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”  Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.",7
His job was to walk calmly into Death’s welcoming arms.,7
"“M-me?” stammered Harry “You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one better — ” “I — yeah — blimey — ” Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.",7
"When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me!",7
"“ALECTO\ If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter — d’you want to go the same way as the Malfoys?",7
"“She wants me to go with her, alone.” “Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.",7
“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry.,7
"Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head.",7
"“You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to Harry.",7
What’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?” she asked Lupin.,7
"Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away.",7
Seconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square.,7
"“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?”  It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so well.",7
"Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione ’s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin.",7
"“Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on you.” “I don’t — ” “The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently.",7
Was Dumbledore at the root of this?,7
"Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.",7
“Six weeks ... seven ...,7
They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.,7
"“I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.” “Yes,” said Harry.",7
"The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.",7
"Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi.",7
"Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless.",7
"Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand.",7
Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly.,7
"He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground-trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond.",7
“Accio Cloak).” roared one of the Death Eaters.,7
He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past.,7
"If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they’ve cast lately, they’ll see that yours broke  mine, they’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.” The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face.",7
"“You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry.",7
"“Piertotum — oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now — ” The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting, “Students out of bed!",7
"But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.” Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.",7
"“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so  grateful if you’d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.” But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens.",7
"“Got a problem with that?” “No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise.",7
"Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village.",7
"He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to his account too.",7
"“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered.",7
"He glared at him, then remembered  a much more pressing question than that of their current location.",7
"“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up.",7
"“But you know what he’d say to us if he was here?” “ ‘C-constant vigilance,’ ” said Hermione, mopping her eyes.",7
"“You are very nearly late.” The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette.",7
"“When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again.",7
"“I’m sure it is,” said Hermione, her eyes upon the church.",7
"“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter.",7
“He didn’t want to be bothered with her.,7
“We’re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” rasped Greyback.,7
"Are you all right?” “It’s okay, everything’s fine.",7
"He had passed out against the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground.",7
"“Mine’s broken.”  “You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again.",7
"... “Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel up to it, er ... please sit up.” It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence.",7
“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off.,7
I am the true master of the Elder Wand.” A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window.,7
"“That is why — it is for that reason — he thinks it means Lily Evans!” “The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore.",7
"I wouldn’t know what I’d done if I’d been possessed, would I?",7
"“I have thought long and hard, Severus.",7
"While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence.",7
"“But even if Bathilda’s completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe even letters.",7
"“We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.” “Well then, why the ’ell am I being ’unted down by ’ouse-elves?",7
Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror.,7
"And then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him.",7
"“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually.",7
"“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione.",7
"“Forget Hogwarts.” Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised.",7

Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him.,7

Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.,7
